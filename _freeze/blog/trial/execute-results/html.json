There is something satisfying about keeping a record. I track what I'm reading on Goodreads (awful app), and what I'm watching on Letterboxd (very good app). I rate everything using each app's rating system: Goodreads is 1-5 stars, whole stars only; Letterboxd is 0-5 stars, half-stars are possible. \n\n\nThe ratings data could be an interesting exercise on selection effects in data collection. Reading a book takes so long that I am not picking books at random and reading and rating them. I instead do a fair amount of research beforehand and pick things I imagine I will like. This has two consequences: \n\n1)  my ratings are pretty clumpy, made worse by the fact that Goodreads only allows whole-star ratings. I'm giving many different kinds of books similar ratings. \n\n2) my ratings are anchored by the minimum level of quality that I am willing to read. A book that I rate a 1 or 2 out of 5 is still way better (or at least in my opinion) than many books that I would not even consider reading. \n\n\nMovies, on the other hand, are much easier to get through, even bad ones. So we should probably see more variation in my ratings; helped too by the fact that Letterboxd allows for half-star ratings. \n\n\n\n\n### Cleaning the data\n\n\nNeither service has an easy API at this point, so I'm manually exporting CSVs every so often to generate this page. \n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nGoodreads does not export the date I started reading a book, so I have to manually add that information. I have a separate CSV file with that info. \n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hrbrthemes)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n\n# set seed\nset.seed(1990)\n\n\n# set theme\ntheme_set(theme_ipsum())\n\n\n# load goodreads data\nbooks = read_csv(here::here(\"personal_files/goodreads.csv\")) |> \n  # clean names\n  janitor::clean_names() |> \n  # subset columns\n  select(title, author, author_l_f, my_rating, average_rating,\n         number_of_pages, year_published, original_publication_year,\n         date_read, date_added, my_review) |> \n  # drop if missing read dates\n  drop_na(date_read) |> \n  # counter of movies watched\n  mutate(counter = 1:n()) |> \n  # separate first name\n  mutate(first_name = str_extract(author, \"^[^\\\\s-]+\")) |> \n  # replace original publication year with publication year if original missing\n  mutate(original_publication_year = ifelse(is.na(original_publication_year), \n                                            year_published, \n                                            original_publication_year))\n\n\n\n# load corrections for dates started\ncorrect = read_csv(here::here(\"personal_files/goodreads_corrections.csv\")) |> \n  select(title, date_added) |> \n  mutate(date_added = mdy(date_added))\n\n\n# correct books\nbooks = left_join(books, correct, by = \"title\") |> \n  mutate(\n    date_added = coalesce(date_added.y, date_added.x)\n  ) %>%\n  select(-date_added.x, -date_added.y) \n\n\n# fix a few stragglers\nbooks$date_added[str_detect(books$title, \"Temptation\")] <- \"2022-02-16\"\nbooks$date_added[str_detect(books$title, \"Full Sea\")] <- \"2022-06-16\"\n\n\n# calculate duration\nbooks = books |> \n  # calculate duration\n  mutate(duration = date_read - date_added,\n         duration = as.numeric(duration))\n\n# load letterboxd data\nmovies = read_csv(here::here(\"personal_files/reviews.csv\")) |> \n   # clean names\n  janitor::clean_names() |> \n  # set rewatch to \"no\" if NA\n  replace_na(list(rewatch = \"no\")) |> \n  # count number of characters in review\n  mutate(review_count = str_count(review, \"\\\\S+\") + 0) |> \n  # counter of movies watched\n  mutate(counter = 1:n())\n\n\npal = MetBrewer::met.brewer(name = \"Degas\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nGoodreads does not provide any information about the authors.

A Life of Nietzsche</strong> by Sue Prideaux<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> September 09, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>_“One repays a teacher badly if one always remains nothing but a pupil_.”<br/><br/>Biographies have a bad habit of lionizing their subject. There’s even a word for this, “hagiography”, and it’s lame because you feel like you’re being spoon-fed something instead of coming to your own conclusion. To my surprise, *I am dynamite!* does the exact opposite of this, although it’s not clear to me how intentional. This is, on the whole, a pretty unflattering portrait of Nietzsche, and not because of his supposed association with Nazism, which the author is adamant about rejecting. <br/><br/>The book is unflattering on a personal level: Nietzsche seems like a small man, neurotic, delusional, totally flaccid. There is at least one woman in the book who, in first meeting him, is shocked by the discrepancy between Nietzsche the writer (passionate, viril, confident) and Nietzsche the person, who seems to melt into the background. I felt the same sense of surprise whenever the author quotes directly from Nietzsche. Anyone who’s read him would probably agree he does not lack passion, whatever you think of his ideas. <br/><br/>Three things stick with me by the end of the biography. First, the unusual, libertine culture among cultural figures during this time in Germany. At the center is Richard Wagner, whom Nietzsche is obsessed with, almost to the point of an erotic relationship. There are many love triangles, and at one point Nietzsche even enters a sort of polycule with a woman and a man, the latter two having paired up first on the mutual agreement of no sex, since they both found it disgusting. It is incredible how much of Nietzsche’s short life is spent on these relationships. <br/><br/>Second, the degree to which Nietzsche’s illnesses shaped his life. I knew Nietzsche had been ill and that he had died in a state of steep mental decline, but I had imagined it was more self-contained. In fact, it was the bulk of his life. He would be ill for long spells, sometimes half the year or more, and his vision rapidly deteriorates in adulthood. This radically shrank his ability to work, and is one reason for his interest in aphorisms; he did not have enough time in good health for longer form writing. <br/><br/>To be sick during this time seems especially gruesome, given the low quality of medicine. He spends years receiving painful treatments (enemas, bleeding) that (we now know) have no bearing on what ails him. There are also some darkly funny moments here: at the time, problems with eyesight were thought to be caused by excessive masturbation. Since Nietzsche was single late into adulthood and either seemingly averse (or just very private) about sex, people speculated that he was a masturbator. Incredibly, Richard Wagner writes letters to Nietzsche’s doctor expressing his belief that Nietzsche’s ailments are the result of him being an excessive masturbator and (IIRC) the doctor even recommends Nietzsche visit brothels. <br/><br/>Third, the incredible story of Nietzsche’s sister, who seems like a real piece of work. I vaguely knew, before reading this book, that Nietzsche’s association with Nazism was somehow her fault. It turns out his sister was a rabid antisemite, something that, interestingly, neither Nietzsche nor their mother shared despite all being very close. They seem almost bewildered by her obsession with the Jews. In one incredible moment, the sister marries an even bigger antisemite than her and they move to Paraguay to start a colony, “Nueva Germania”, that would exist on antisemitic ideals. Moving to Paraguay, just years after the war of the Triple Alliance (in which Paraguay is almost exterminated), all to get away from the Jews seems like peak “cut off your nose to spite your face”. <br/><br/>The colony fails and she fails, in almost every regard, except that she is the one left holding all the cards when Nietzsche’s mother dies, leaving her unopposed to manage his archive and to live with him while he is in this horrible catatonic state. Truly creepy, I would read a book just about her. <br/><br/>I loved Nietzsche as a teenager. I wonder if he holds up. <br/></p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>A Popular History of Idi Amin's Uganda</strong> by Derek R. Peterson<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> September 08, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>I remember watching *The Last King of Scotland* in high school and thinking it was great, even rewatching it a few times. It probably says something that, despite watching the movie so many times, I  had no idea what country Idi Amin was in charge of, or where Uganda was on the map. I picked up this book to correct my ignorance as I start working on a research project with some relevance to Uganda. <br/><br/>This is a straightforward academic text. Every chapter could be a standalone article; each starts with an overview of the big picture takeaway; then a page break, the empirical content to support the takeaway; and then a page-break to conclusion. I will never understand why academic writing, supposedly aimed at an audience more attuned to difficult reading, traditionally spoon feeds the reader like this. That said, an interesting and worthwhile book about Uganda’s most famous leader. Less a comprehensive overview and more a series of chapters that each touch on a theme of his rule. <br/><br/>Here are some things that stood out. First, the fact that Uganda is composed of kingdoms, which persisted through British colonialism and into independence. Each kingdom was pretty close to autonomous, with its own laws, parliament, and even police force. For Idi Amin’s story, the most important kingdom is Buganda, encompassing the modern day capital of Kempala. During independence, each kingdom seems to want to go its own way, especially Buganda. There are also strong inter-ethnic tensions among the country’s many communities. <br/><br/>A weak electoral process brings Obote to power whom, because of the pre-existing kingdoms, has little in the way of actual power. His first move is to thus crush the ancient Kingdoms, famously so the kingdom of Buganda. Given these pre-existing forms of political organization and hostile neighbors, Obote’s government is a “nervous state”, paranoid of overthrow. With good reason, it turns out: he is ultimately overthrown by one of his generals, Idi Amin, while Obote is out of the country in 1971. <br/><br/>Second, that at the time of independence there are a number of South Asian people living in Uganda (analogous to other British colonies, such as Trinidad and Tobago). These communities skew better off, tending to own significant amounts of small capital, businesses, etc. There is deep resentment of this population: one of the earliest forms of popular mobilization around independence is a boycott of South Asian businesses. Idi Amin’s early rule will focus on expelling this community from Uganda as part of his so-called “Economic War”. This is, by the way, how we get Zohran Mandami as the likely mayor in NYC; his father is a famous Ugandan academic who was expelled during this time. <br/><br/>Third, while Idi Amin’s brutality is well known (the “Hitler of Africa”), I had less exposure to his efforts to make Uganda the frontline of anti-colonial struggle in Africa. A very interesting moment is that early on (even pre-coup, it seems) he is in close contact with Israel, who offer him training and support. But after a trip to Mecca in the 1970s he breaks off all contact with Israel and pivots to a Gaddafi-inflected pan-Africanism. He seems to wage very little actual war on this front, mostly a matter of presentation: author tells a story of Idi Amin training and arming fighters to go to South Africa / Rhodesia, but this is all for show: they are made to return weapons and even uniforms after the photo op. Culturally, Idi Amin’s regime will do a lot more: banning mini skirts, wigs, Evangelical Christianity, change the names of streets, etc. <br/><br/>In the end, Idi Amin’s regime ends when he invades neighboring Tanzania and the latter counter-mobilizes, invades Uganda, and unseats him, shocking everyone given Idi Amin’s grip on the country. <br/><br/>As with reading about any leader who use repression to close off imagined coups, one wonders to what extent the leader’s level of paranoia is warranted. Liberal-democratic re-tellings of these periods (thinking here of the Southern Cone countries, or the Soviet Union) tend to emphasize the “imagined” part: that the paranoia, fear of an internal threat, of wreckers, etc., is objectively overblown. But if you personally coup’d your predecessor, what else are you supposed to think?</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Quantum Criminals: Ramblers, Wild Gamblers, and Other Sole Survivors from the Songs of Steely Dan (American Music Series)</strong> by Alex Pappademas<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> September 07, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>This book feels like it was written with me in mind. *Quantum Criminals* is not a biography, it’s a series of essays on Steely Dan, each using a specific song (chronological order) in their catalog as a jumping off point to talk about their influences, approach, the lyrics, and Donald and Walter. I *loved* this format: read a chapter, catch what song they are discussing, pop that on, back to the book. I would happily read more books like this, especially about bands that I’ve struggled to “get”. <br/><br/>More than the format though, the way the authors frame Steely Dan’s status in the culture  captures how I have felt about the band. For people my age, growing up on indie rock bands that emphasized a sincere, low-fi / low-effort authenticity, the glossy sound of Steely Dan and other 70s soft rock bands reads as fake, overly produced, everything anathema to “real music”. Of course, as you get older, you realize that making sure everyone’s wearing flannel or having songs that start with someone plugging a guitar into a hot amp, studio chatter, or the drummer counting them in, are no less “fake”: these are all choices being made to deliberately convey some kind vibe. <br/><br/>With the Dan / yacht rock renaissance I’ve come to appreciate their music more, although I still wonder to what extent my enjoyment is sincere. That said, they have undeniable bangers. “Peg” does something weird to my brain, it feels impossibly groovy; reminds me of Mario kart music. And lyrically what they are doing is much more complex than I realized, more in the Dylan vein of songwriting. <br/><br/>Would recommend the behind the album documentary on YouTube about Aja to pair with this book.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Mason & Dixon</strong> by Thomas Pynchon<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> September 07, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>In college (or was it grad school?) my now wife and I went to India with another couple. We took trains all the way from Mumbai to Dharamshala, and part of the way back. On those long train ride (20+ hours) with nothing else to do, no phones, etc., I read *Gravity’s Rainbow* and was blown away. <br/><br/>Not only had I never read anything like it before, I also feel it broadened my ability to read and my appetite for difficult books. One: to focus less on the internal logic of the story and more on the meaning of the writing; in all his books, Pynchon is riffing and improvising and just doing crazy jazz shit with language. Two: to be OK with losing the thread of the story, getting lost, or turning to secondary sources to figure out what the hell is going on. I think for most people, that experience of getting lost triggers a defensive reaction: if there is no grand plan for the plot or the prose, then this is pointless, like hearing someone press random keys on a piano. But just as with improvisational music, the whole point is the musician/author’s ability to dance on that line between unintelligible noise and something sublime. <br/><br/>Since then, I've read *Inherent Vice* (IMO: the PTA movie the best book adaptation of all time) and *Lot 49*, both of which I loved. That said, *Mason & Dixon* beat me. An absolute slog to get through. The plot itself is barely there, the prose so obtuse, and the time period not one I am familiar enough with to really feel like I had my bearings. Maybe it’s unfortunate timing – I started reading this a few weeks prior to my daughter’s birth, and then finished in the following months, sleep deprived, starving for entertainment. Maybe not a great time for difficult books. <br/><br/>There are a few standout moments. Surprisingly enough, as much as I wanted them to get to America already my favorite parts of the book are in the earlier sections, when they’re in South Africa and sailing. And then towards the end, the Hollow Earth stuff was interesting. But the story within the story felt tedious and too little “happens” while they’re in America to make the juice worth the squeeze.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>When the Clock Broke: Con Men, Conspiracists, and How America Cracked Up in the Early 1990s</strong> by John Ganz<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> September 01, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>> With the inspiration of the death of the Soviet Union before us, we now know that it can be done. With Pat Buchanan as our leader, we shall break the clock of social democracy. We shall break the clock of the Great Society. We shall break the clock of the welfare state. We shall break the clock of the New Deal.. We shall repeal the twentieth century.<br/><br/>I’m still not sure how we went from: a world where newspapers with large teams, high-quality editing, expensive reporting, and numerous “big deal” op-ed writers would struggle to get people to sign up for $20 a month, to now: where an individual writer, singularly producing blog posts with often no editing, at unspecified intervals, can get many, many people to fork over $5 a month. I’ve tried subscribing to a few but I don’t even like the rambling, long-form blog format for free, let alone paying for it. <br/><br/>Anyway, this is part of John Ganz’s fame (though apparently he now also writes for The Nation). I have never read John Ganz before this book, but I am impressed. This could easily be my favorite book of the year. The writing is superb, and the level of detail he wrings out of the cast of characters in the book — people you you think you “know”, like David Duke — reminds me of Rick Perlstein’s work. But while Perlstein’s books are way too long, Ganz cuts through the fat. <br/><br/>The book’s thesis — never fully elaborated, even in the introduction, just left to the reader to connect the dots (very cool; the antithesis of academic writing which needs to spell everything out, down to an enumerated list of what each chapter is about; even though ironically academic writing is supposedly aimed at a more “specialized” audience) — is that the early 1990s is *the* period to look at to understand the current MAGA-right’s roots. I left the book feeling like I understood something new about Trump, MAGA, and whatever is going on with the people in the Thiel-verse. <br/><br/>There are many parallels between the 90s and today. The chapter on David Duke alone is worth the price of admission. His racism is obviously well-known, but the fact that he was a major grifter (constantly trying to raise a buck off his supporters), vain (he got a ton of plastic surgery), and good at TV makes an uncanny resemblance to Trump at times. <br/><br/>The paleoconservatives, also discussed here, are a clear intellectual influence on MAGA. The idea that America is in decline, that there’s a new world order, that Americans are being taken advantage of by foreigners (at that time, it was Japan that drew ire), etc., that’s all in MAGA but especially the hatred of the more neo-con wing of the Republican party. All of this is captured perfectly in Rothbard’s essay advocating for a radical, populist conservatism. <br/><br/>Even culturally, you have the rise of a loneliness epidemic in the discourse, especially among young men; concern about the rise of talk radio and parasocial relationships (clear analog to today’s podcasts); a moral panic about crime in urban areas, and of course, the Rodney King trial giving way to riots, aclear analog to summer of Floyd (one of many interesting details being that the beating was caught on camcorder by a neighbor, the footage effectively going viral before virality was a thing); and a Democratic Party that feels it has lost too many recent elections, with an ascendant moderate wing blaming losses to Reagan on the party’s progressive faction. <br/><br/>Many similarities, what is different? The big difference to me seems to be Bill Clinton. In response to a cultural turn to the right, Democrats put up a candidate who was willing to embody very conservatively coded policy positions *and* persona. For example, Clinton famously flew back to Arkansas to oversee the execution of a man on death row with significant mental deficiencies. He didn’t just do this, he *campaigned* on it, which is wild to think about a Democrat doing today. As far as I can see, there is nothing like this emerging within the Democratic Party. But who knows; maybe this is the year.  <br/><br/><br/>PS: the chapter on Ruby Ridge and the White Nationalist movement was also fascinating, would read a book just on that.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Lou Reed: The King of New York</strong> by Will Hermes<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> August 25, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>*Lou Reed: The King of New York* seems like the most complete biography of Lou Reed out there, covering his childhood, time with the Velvets, solo career, and his death in 2013. <br/><br/>A personal anecdote about Lou Reed: I went to graduate school imagining that I would do qualitative, deep history research on Colombia’s armed conflict. Then I got there and all anyone wanted to talk about were coefficient estimates, standard errors, and natural experiments. I went through a crisis: is this really what I want to do? If I do it “their” way, am I selling out? If I do it “my way”, will I not be able to write for a living at all? What do I even want to do, really?<br/><br/>I was in therapy at the time, both for grad school woes and for some difficult family dynamics. My therapist then laid out the story I would come to re-learn in this book: that Lou Reed starts out his music career writing songs for this strange record label, *Pickwick Records*. The company, interestingly, was proto AI slop: they would hire musicians to quickly and cheaply write a ton of songs about specific themes (e.g., songs about going to the beach; Reed famously wrote a “do the dance” song called “Ostrich”). So the story goes, the payments from writing this garbage is what allowed Reed live as a musician and eventually write some of the influential rock music of all time. So the lesson is something like: you can be practical and still true to yourself, whatever that is. <br/><br/>It is interesting in the book that Lou does not sweat this at all; there is no crisis of legitimacy, “am I a sell out”, etc. It is clear he sees working for Pickwick as practical and not a reflection of him as a person. This ethos continued throughout his life as he licensed his music / persona for commercials (clearly influenced by Warhol in this regard as well): having his songs appear in a Ford commercial or whatever is fine if it lets him finance his weird, commercially unviable rock albums. The experience also turned out to be useful to Reed: the Pickwick workflow of putting music out at inhuman speeds came in handy for the Velvets, who were operating on shoe-string budgets. Note: they actually recently released his Pickwick record music as a standalone album. <br/><br/>Anecdote aside, my exposure to Reed was through the Velvets, a band that made a huge impression on me as a teenager, drawn to the band’s experimental sound and “edgy” lyrics. I still remember hearing the song “Heroin” for the first time and being blown away by the droning viola, the drumming, Lou’s delivery, and of course, the vivid lyrics about shooting up. I would eventually make my way through the band’s other albums and fell in love with the music. Even today, it is still in heavy rotation at the house. <br/><br/>Given this exposure, one of the more surprising things about the book is how short-lived and unsuccessful the Velvet Underground’s tenure was. Shorter still once you realize that Lou kicks John Cale out of the band after *White Light/White Heat*, meaning that what for a long time had been my favorite album (the self-titled LP) was not, really, a fully VU record. <br/><br/>One of the things you want out of a biography is a sense of the historical figure as a person. The view that emerges of Lou is a pretty unflattering one. He is controlling and nasty to people around him, both near and distant; you have the fallout with Andy Warhol which, from Warhol’s diaries, we can tell was extremely painful (and needlessly so). There is also berating of service staff of all kind, both during his chaotic years of addiction *and* his post-sobriety-ish, Tai Chi master, later period. He is painfully thin-skinned, calculating, someone who frets about how much others are getting (relative to him), where he is in the pecking order, how others perceive him, etc. <br/><br/>These latter qualities might produce someone who is always trying to do whatever is “in” at the moment, without much vision or sense of organic direction. But this is not true of Lou, which in the end is one of the most touching elements of the biography. There are all these tensions in Lou, maybe between his person and the character he plays on the records. Lou was insanely prolific, even publishing a photography book late in life, a quality that runs counter to the desire to protect one’s image. His solo music, perhaps the only exception being the excellent *Transformer*, is also almost invariably out of step with the times, deeply uncool. Too many examples to point out: the Edgar Allan Poe album, the over-the-top edgelord lyrics (“Harry’s circumcision”), and of course the infamous last album with the deeply uncool Metallica. Whatever you say about him, he clearly had vision and passion, which I found inspiring. <br/><br/>The last chapter, detailing his relationship with Laurie Anderson and death, was unexpectedly touching. Here is a man who has “done everything” and, in the twilight of his life, throws himself into a new relationship, martial arts and Tai Chi (shout out to the song “Lou Reed”, by Cory Hanson). Basically: there is always more life to live. Whatever corner you painted yourself into, whatever constraints you imagine on yourself, you can always do something new.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>How to Talk So Little Kids Will Listen: A Survival Guide to Life with Children Ages 2-7</strong> by Joanna Faber<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> August 24, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>*How to talk so little kids will listen* is a sequel (?) to the classic 1970s parenting advice book. From what I can tell, the core ideas are much the same. <br/><br/>An interesting thing about the book is that it doesn’t foreground a particular philosophy about child-rearing. There is definitely one there, but it is more subtext than text. The authors are not telling you “this is the way the child works”, they are more presenting approaches to problem-solving common challenges with children. <br/><br/>The philosophy that the book does espouse about child-rearing is that one should take kids, and especially their emotions, seriously. This might sound obvious, but as a parent, it is often not. Imagine a toddler asks you to cut a strawberry in half, regrets it and asks you to reverse that process, then tantrums when you cannot. In these moments, it is hard to see past the insanity of what they are crying about. In other words, it is easy to see little kids as irrational, or at least the stuff that upsets them. <br/><br/>And maybe it is irrational. Maybe they get upset about a wider, less compelling set of things than adult do (though if we are honest, we let ourselves get upset about plenty). But they are upset nonetheless, and you cannot tell someone who is upset not to be upset. It doesn’t matter if the reason they are upset is that they were brutally fired from work, or if they ate their M&Ms in the wrong order. <br/><br/>This was a really effective component of the book: drawing analogies between what children are feeling in these moments and what we feel as adults. These analogies make very clear why acknowledging emotions is important. You can't tell an adult who's mother died that they should stop crying, their mother was old and sick anyway. <br/><br/>In practice, this means talking to you child with empathy about what they are upset about. It also means modeling how to deal with these emotions and problem-solve, which is not easy. But it rings true to me. There's a ton of ideas here, and the \"workshop\" narration (parents in a room talking to one another about issues, approaches, etc.) works great. <br/><br/>I also appreciated how much the book highlights the parents’ experience; it’s not just about the kid. There’s a short chapter in particular on when parents feel overwhelmed by anger at something their child is doing, which I found refreshingly candid. That anger is not ideal, but it is also part of life: children will run into people who they will make angry or who will become angry at them for a variety of reasons, people close to them or strangers. They need to learn how to deal with these moments, and it is also instructive post-rage to come back together and “make up”: that this is a healthy part of human life. <br/><br/>Like with all things, not everything works like you imagine. I was struck by a passage where the author, whose kid is struggling with starting/stopping tasks (e.g., playing), gets a timer with a shade that shrinks as the timer counts down, so the passage of time is visible and thus intelligible to a little kid. I immediately ordered that clock, showed my two year old, set a time to play until we had to leave for school. He picked up the clock, and simply added more time. :)<br/><br/>I’ve been going through some parenting struggles and this book really did it for me, I’m all in with this shit. <br/></p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Your Two-Year-Old: Terrible or Tender</strong> by Louise Bates Ames<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> August 14, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p><br/>This book is part of a series by the child developmental psychologist Louise Bates Ames. Each short book covers a year in the life of the child. The books cover, in broad strokes, how the child is changing psychologically, socially, emotionally, physically, etc. <br/><br/>I was motivated to read this because my two year old was driving me insane, nearly to the point of tears. I truly wanted to know: what the fuck is going on in there? Why is he doing all this? <br/><br/>I have to say: I got a lot out of reading this. Short, to the point, and the right tone for me as a parent: fairly relaxed, low stakes, more about adjusting your expectations to your child than what more contemporary child-rearing books tend to emphasize, which is *improving* or *maximizing* your child in some respect. I feel that I understand my two year old better after reading. <br/><br/>If I had to characterize Ames’ approach for a child this age it is to avoid confrontation, which does not mean caving to the child’s demands, more of the way that in judo you use your opponent’s momentum against them. Basically, where you can avoid confrontation, avoid it: don’t ask questions where the answer can be “no” or where they can refuse without consequence, because they will. At two, the child is testing the boundaries around what is possible, discovering to some degree their autonomy. They will refuse, reject, want to do the opposite of what you request almost by nature. <br/><br/>One parental instinct here is to say “that is unacceptable”, the world does not revolve around them, I will hold my ground. Ames would say this is basically fruitless because the refusal is literally part of the developmental stage that they are in. And it is a stage, they will not stay there. It is therefore OK / advisable to instead leverage the fact that you are much smarter than them to divert their attention, change the subject, etc. At least this week, I feel like this works; who knows about the next. <br/><br/>The book has a fair number of bad reviews, due I think to its age (written in the 1970s), which shows in many parts. Things like the book warning you not to let your kid touch the dash when they’re riding in the front seat with you is funny now. There’s also a ton of gendered assumptions in here with respect to mothers and fathers. Doesn’t bother me; seems easy enough to mentally replace: “a stern warning from Dad” with a “stern warning from [the more strict parent of the two / the most intimidating member of the polycule]” . I actually found it touching how much of the book felt timeless. <br/><br/>One last reaction is that as someone in the social sciences, I can’t help but be skeptical about the harder claims in the book. How, exactly, could Ames “knows” what is going on in the child’s mind? She also breaks stages down to 6 month intervals, which seems impossibly precise. I personally do not remember what my son was like at 2 years versus 2 and a half, versus now. Of course, Ames is careful to note that all children are different, and so basically all of what she says could not apply in your particular instance. So… what are we doing here? I guess you just have to believe. <br/><br/>Worth the read. I bought year 3 too. Do I peak ahead to see what this monster has in store for me or leave it as a surprise?</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>My Name Is Red</strong> by Orhan Pamuk<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> July 30, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>*My name is red* is Orhan Pamuk’s  best-known book, at least in the West. Pamuk is also Turkey’s best-known fiction writer, at least in the West. So this is Turkish fiction 101; something like picking up Marquez as a first stab at Colombian (or even Latin American) fiction. I wanted to read this after listening to the excellent Empire podcast on the Ottoman Empire ([[Fall of Ottoman Empire, empire pod]]). I also picked up *The Ottomans*, which is still sitting on my bookshelf. <br/><br/>The story follows a group of miniaturists – an art form based on embroidering texts with depictions of historical events, battles, etc. – in the late 1500s Ottoman Empire as they grapple with their changing art form and the mysterious murder of two of their members. The story is told in a relational style: each chapter is a character relating events to the reader who is at the same time placed in the position of some unidentified third party that exists in the story. <br/><br/>The most straightforward read of the book is as an allegory for Turkey’s unique place in the world, a country that straddles “east” and “west”. Pamuk’s miniaturists are consumed with anxieties about the seeping of “Frankish” style (i.e., Western Renaissance art) into their art form. The discussion of the differences in style are some of the most interesting parts of the novel. The miniaturists, for instance, are especially troubled by the use of perspective in Frankish art, which they perceive as a kind of idolatry. Their traditional art form instead “lacks” perspective, imagining itself as presenting the world as Allah sees it: trees, dogs, buildings, people, all the same size, flattened in some sense. <br/><br/>Part of the reason they are anxious about these new forms they are coming into contact with is that there is something alluring about them. This is key to the allegory, IMO: it is not the case that the western forms are being exogenously imposed on Ottoman artists. At this point, in fact, the Ottoman Empire is arguably at the peak of its power. Rather, there is something innately alluring about Western art, especially portraiture, which Ottoman leaders (the Sultan) instinctively finds appealing because of its grandiosity and projection of power. <br/><br/>This ambiguity is where I think Pamuk keeps the reader in most of the novel. We should find something distressing about the encroachment of Western art, the loss of these indigenous art forms. But we should also probably be disturbed by the orthodox, puritanical rejection of those who burn down the storyteller’s tavern at the end of the book. <br/><br/>Parallel to all this is interesting fodder is an epic love triangle romance with great characters, world-building, dialogue, etc. This is peak historical fiction.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Right-Wing Women</strong> by Andrea Dworkin<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> May 05, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>*Right-wing women* got billed as an analysis of women on the right by the firebrand feminist Andrea Dworkin. But the book is much broader than that, also delving into Dworkin’s broader feminist framework, social value in a gendered society, abortion, reproductive technologies, and so on. There's actually not a ton here on \"right wing women\" as such. <br/><br/>I’d heard of Dworkin before, mostly through her role in the \"pornography wars\" discussed in [[The right to sex]]. This was my first time reading her work directly. <br/><br/>Dworkin's style is to make big, sharp claims (a big change from [[The right to sex]], which felt like all elaboration and no hard claims); she is machine-gunning ideas; she is sarcastic, angry, funny; when she’s really going, it's great. <br/><br/>The standouts are the first, standout chapter, “The promise of the ultra-right” and the chapter on abortion. Her take on right-wing women is that they, like left-wing feminists, are acutely aware of the violence and domination that is inherent (Dworkin is a bit unclear on this) to relationships with men, and so seek a compromised (false) safety in marriage and control over reproduction via opposition to abortion. As Dworkin writes, “the Right promises to put enforceable constraints on male aggression, thus simplifying survival for women”. She looks at specific anti-feminist women of the era, whom I had known little about and found fascinating. Phyllis Schaffley being a war hawk in her origins but pivoting to women’s social issues because the Reagan administration would not give her a formal role was an interesting bit of history. <br/><br/>Dworkin’s takedown of the hippie movement and the counterculture in the abortion chapter is particularly brutal and effective, maybe the best part of the book: “[sexual liberation] did not free women. Its purpose – it turned out – was to free men to use women without bourgeois constraints”. Here she is writing directly from experience about the abuse and dismissive treatment of women in the radical organizations of this period.<br/><br/>Aside from these chapters, however, the writing is rough. The rest of the book is truly a slog. The writing is just *so* repetitive; she repeats sentences, for rhetorical effect no doubt, and I could imagine a speech where the repetition works. But not as a book. The content is also less interesting later on, amorphous. The most precise claims in the latter half of the book is chapter on Christianity, where she makes the (very odd) claim that homophobia is unique to the New Testament and that in the Old Testament, whatever prohibitions were in place, were in some broad sense perhaps more tolerant (?). It’s an odd piece. <br/><br/>It would be interesting to know what Dworkin would say about the world today.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>La guerra del fin del mundo</strong> by Mario Vargas Llosa<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> April 17, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>The “end of the world” in the title refers to a remote town in the state of Bahia, Brazil, where a staggering 25,000 people, led by a messianic figure / cult leader known as  Antônio Conselheiro (“Anthony the Counselor”), lived in open defiance of the Brazilian state in the late 1800s. The town,  Canudos — apparently now gone, flooded by a damn built by the country’s dictatorship in the 1960s – became the site of Brazil’s bloodiest civil war. Federal troops fought bitterly with residents over control of the town, effectively exterminating the town’s inhabitants in the process. The novel is thus about the “War of Canudos”, told from the perspective of various characters on both sides of the conflict. <br/><br/>A messianic figure emerging in Brazil, at this time, when the Brazilian republic is just born and slavery is abolished; the unorthodox nature of the Counselor’s belief system (anti-republican, monarchical, anti-slavery, anti-metric system); the fact that the residents successfully repel multiple waves of federal troops, killing a famous general in the process; this background gave me very high expectations for this novel. This is rich history, in a part of the country that receives little attention. Brazil’s _**sertão**_ is poor, plagued with droughts that produce famines, a kind of desert outback which outsiders rarely associate with Brazil. <br/><br/>I was disappointed with this book. What did I want? The War of Canudos is genuinely bizarre; I wanted someone who could extract meaning, give me a sense for what these people who gathered at Canudos, wanted. This event is important, forgotten to history, but what does it *mean*? I did not come away with a sense that Vargas Llosa (RIP, one of the GOATs) has a clear, convincing view of what the *War of Canudos* means. <br/><br/>The Counselor himself is sparsely detailed in the novel, he doesn’t speak much, there are obvious parallels to the biblical Jesus. The reader’s view of both the Counselor and his followers feels modern, removed: these are people with strange beliefs, cult-like; there is not a ton of room for empathy for these people as *believers* (although certainly as victims, or as oppressed people). I wanted a sense for what it would *feel like* to believe what they believe, but we rarely get much interiority into the characters. Many seem to just become enthralled soon after meeting the Counselor. Now, maybe this is “The Truth” about what happened in Canudos; but it’s not so compelling. <br/><br/>The other side of the narrative is the military and those characters who are foreign to the region. Here, too, I think there is a disappointing lack of engagement with interesting ideas: you have a new republic, but there are debates about what it should look like, and a clear clash between a kind of modernizing liberalism and a reactionary conservatism that is one of the turning points of Latin American politics in the 19th and 20th century. In between, is this town, that doesn’t want to be incorporated. Yet, Vargas Lllosa makes it fairly clear on that on the military side there is not much beyond cynicism, desire for control, etc. Again, maybe the truth, but didn’t grab me. <br/><br/>In the end, the conflict itself feels like more of a backdrop to a story that is primarily a romance, with grand, sweeping emotions and characters who feel-very-strongly. As I read, the movie that I came coming back to was “Gone with the Wind”. That’s fine, but it didn’t grab me. And to top it off: this is a very long book, and dense with characters. Honestly, a slog to get through.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Anti-Semite and Jew: An Exploration of the Etiology of Hate</strong> by Jean-Paul Sartre<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> March 26, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>In *Anti-semite and Jew*, Sartre reflects on the “logic” of anti-semitism in France. It's the end of the second World War, and many French Jews who were deported by the Nazis are beginning to return. In a broad sense, Sartre wants to explore how antisemitism \"works\" at the level of the individual: what does it “do” for the antisemite to be antisemitic? In line with his prior writing, he sees a psychological dialectic at play in the persistence of these beliefs: antisemites and Jewish people locked in a mutually “reinforcing” dance. <br/><br/>It’s an interesting time to read this book. Since Musk took over, my Twitter feed is full of far right accounts, many discretely or openly flirting with antisemitism, Nazi apologism, etc. I’m still in shock about how blatant it is. I can see some of the traits Sartre highlights at play with these Twitter figures. <br/><br/>This book would be hard to write today. As Walzer points out in the preface, Sartre is neither Jewish nor well-versed in Jewish culture. Yet, that does not mean he can’t say something interesting about antisemitism. In fact, he is shockingly candid about how much antisemitism exists in his social circle (unsaid: that he effectively tolerates) and much of his theorizing is specific to his experiences in France. On that front, the etiquette today – that only members of a group should comment on that group – seems bad.<br/><br/>The first chapter on the antisemite is really all that’s worth reading here. And it is a really interesting set of observations, almost aphoristic. He characterizes antisemitism as a *choice* (famously: “if the Jew did not exist, the antisemite would invent him”), that seeks out facts that support the view rather than the other way around, which perhaps distinguishes antisemitism from other forms of “ethnic” hatred. At its core, Sartre diagnoses the antisemite with a desire for impenetrability, a discomfort with the ambiguities of truth. <br/><br/>Especially interesting – thinking back to Twitter, and the right wing accounts who are “haha kidding but not really” playing with antisemitic tropes – is Sartre’s noticing that the antisemite fundamentally “plays”, that there is a layer of amusement (today we would say trolling) to their discourse. “They delight in acting in bad faith”, they do not stand by their arguments because their beliefs are not rooted in reason but a kind of anti-reason. The tension that Sartre notices between the antisemite (and more broadly the fascist’s) love of order, and yet the desire to break that order, is very interesting, the tendency towards hooliganism, pogrom, destruction… I think he also clarifies some things about the concept of the “Deep State” among the modern far right: “Thus for the anti-Semite there is a *real* France with a government but diffused and without special organs, and an abstract France, official, Jew-ridden, against which it is proper to rebel.”<br/><br/>Michael Walzer’s preface is worth reading too, he does not seem like a fan.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Making Empire: Ireland, Imperialism, and the Early Modern World</strong> by Jane Ohlmeyer<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> March 21, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>I was disappointed by this book or, at least, I had the wrong expectations going into it. I picked it up after hearing the author on *Empire Pod*, imagining something more accessible about the history of early English imperialism in Ireland. But the book is very “academic”; the acknowledgments indicate it is based on lectures the author gave in university. Probably as a result, there is a frustrating level of detail throughout, at times giving way too little background on proper noun characters and at others focusing much too narrowly on individual people / towns. All to say, I didn’t get all that much out of reading this. <br/><br/>Here’s what I found interesting: the idea that Ireland is the “first” British colony, the only colonized country in western Europe; the steps the English took to try to “anglicize” Ireland early on; the process of using both settlers (“plantations”) to dispossess the locals *and* (interestingly) the “carrot” of being made nobility to win over the elites; and the way that colonial practices in Ireland would later be reflected in other colonies, down to specific people (one Irish man who worked in colonial policing in Ireland, India, and Palestine). The Irish being sent all over the world was also surprising, but makes sense; that’s how you get the hilariously named Bernardo O’Higgins as a Chilean founding father. <br/><br/>These are interesting ideas but they don’t get a lot of development. There’s also an emphasis on culture and discourse that I know is interesting to some people, but not to me. That colonial administrators in Ireland would conceptualize the island’s “problems” in disease-like language, and that this same language would later show up in India, is not so interesting to me. What I found more interesting was how often the Irish were invoked in North America: “the wild irish and the indian do not much differ”. There’s a dark comedy there where the colonizer recognizes these “similarities” in otherwise very dissimilar peoples but fails to recognize the common denominator (the colonial relationship).</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>How Asia Works: Success and Failure in the World's Most Dynamic Region</strong> by Joe Studwell<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> March 12, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>*How Asia Works* argues that the reason some Asian economies succeeded (the so-called “tiger” economies, e.g., Japan, Taiwan, South Korea) and others failed (e.g., the Philippines, Myanmar) comes down to industrial policy: some states aggressively pointed their economies in the direction of development while others did not. <br/><br/><br/>The book is provocative and interesting to read in light of all that is going on with Trump and his tariffs. Studwell is arguing principally against the neoclassical economic take that state intervention in the economy is bad and that free trade is fundamentally good; in Studwell’s view, free trade is a position that advantages already-rich countries to the detriment of poorer ones, and that if one looks at the history of how rich countries developed, one would see that they did so squarely through heavy state intervention in the economy, via land reform and protectionist policies that sheltered domestic manufacturing, allowing firms to grow and become globally competitive. He uses Asia to test these ideas. <br/><br/>This summary makes Studwell sound like a conventional left-wing economist, but his ideas are actually a lot more heterodox and interesting. Early in a country’s development, he advocates for land reform, and particularly land redistribution – away from feudal estates, and towards smaller landholdings – but on the grounds that these small farms are in fact more competitive, more “capitalist” in some sense, than the big farms where landowners can grow fat off rents. <br/><br/>The history in this chapter is fascinating. I had: a) no idea of the substantial level of land reform and redistribution that some Asian countries took on, but even more surprising: b) the degree to which the US encouraged these reforms both as development measures in their own right (in Japan, Korea, Taiwan) and as counterinsurgency tools to demobilize rural unrest. In Taiwan and Korea in particular it seems the US actively pushed for breaking up big farms, which is shocking. <br/><br/>He is also heterodox with respect to protectionist policies once states are at the development stage where manufacturing is plausible. States need to protect their domestic industries through tariffs and subsidies, but must maintain “export discipline”: that is, the protected industries must be forced to compete in the global marketplace. Absent being forced, domestic industries will happily absorb the subsidies and do little that will generate wider development. So in some sense, a pretty dangerous tool: there needs to be the willpower to push companies to compete globally even when its not in their interest (given protections). The narrative here is also interesting, especially so Korea’s impressive development of car and steel manufacturing so “late” in their history. One feels that if Korea can do it, why not, say, Brazil? <br/><br/>Something striking about the policies that Studwell proposes is that, broadly, they are probably 1) quite painful to implement and 2) unlikely to easily generate a coalition of people who’s interest is in maintaining them. As economists will note, the costs of tariffs and other protections are borne by consumers. We are currently screaming about 6-7% interest rates; Studwell points to something like a decade of 10-15% interest rates in Korea. Could people really tolerate that? In the pursuit of some long term goal? With respect to (2), you can’t help but notice that the people pushing painful development through in South Korea, China and Taiwan are dictators. Can democracies do this? The rich democracies certainly did, so maybe there’s hope. <br/><br/>Overall, the history of state intervention in the economy is interesting in that for most of the time period discussed it actually seems to intersect little with the traditional left-right spectrum or the Cold War. Today these ideas are totally “polarized”: if you’re on the right you oppose intervention, on the left support it, and what’s at stake is some trade-off between efficiency and equity. But for these early leaders, these were simply tools that they could choose to use (or not). Which makes sense: for most of history, the idea that a country’s leaders would “not meddle” in their country’s economic activity was implausible. The question was not if, but how. <br/><br/>I do have to say I found Studwell kind of grating at times. There’s a ton of “telling” in this book but not a lot of showing; huge, vast claims are made about why something happened or what effect X has on Y. Claims about the size of farms, how wealthy or poor people were at some particular time/place, etc., are rattled off, but it’s unclear how Studwell can really “know” any of this. In fact, he reminds me a lot of Noah Smith, who also has an unpleasant tendency to over-claim expertise and to tell these grand narrative type stories that are nice and neat but seem implausibly overconfident. <br/></p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Stories of Your Life and Others</strong> by Ted Chiang<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> February 26, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>Chiang’s move in these short stories is to take what are often obtuse academic concepts and humanize them, give them stakes, and build characters who interact in worlds where these concepts have weight. He draws on hermeneutics in *Tower of Babylon*, linguistics in *Story of your life*, math in *Division by Zero*, etc. <br/><br/>For my money, the standout in the bunch is *Tower of Babylon*. Chiang focuses on the routine, daily mechanics of building the tower; what material to use, how workers make the climb, how people live on the tower. The focus on engineering gives the story a realism that produces a clever dramatic irony where, as you read, you imagine that the builders will discover what you already know: that there is no “vault of heaven”, but rather outer space. This makes the moment when they reach the vault of heaven very effective and opens the narrative up. That the builders never give a positive account of *why* they are building the tower is interesting, especially once the vault is reached and you learn that piercing the vault could trigger world-ending flooding. The question is never “should we do this” but rather the mechanics of minimizing the potential damage. Obvious parallels there to real-world science: the atom bomb, the hadron collider, etc. <br/><br/>The second best story is the one that the book is named after. *Story of your life* is  impressive in sketching out what it would feel like to interact with a non-human language, one that still conformed to some kind of structure. There’s a “pleasure of mastery” as the narrator slowly develops the ability to communicate with the Heptapods. Unfortunately, the story ends up suffering from what I’ll call “Interstellar Syndrome”, referring to the sci-fi movie by Christopher Nolan. Nolan’s movie begins with “hard science” and ends up in the world of “California woo” after the main character falls into a black hole and discovers the universe is powered by Love. This short story similarly made me squirm with the time-traveling bit revealed at the end. <br/><br/>The other stories are not very good.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>The Frontier Effect: State Formation and Violence in Colombia</strong> by Teo Ballve<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> February 06, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>The *Frontier Effect* is a book about Uraba, a region in Colombia near the border with Panama. Uraba is a microcosm of the country’s violent conflicts – you can truly see every element of the conflict at play in Uraba. Early on, an “underdeveloped” backwater that grows quickly due to the booming banana industry and early colonos. Later, a hotspot for guerrilla organizing, especially the FARC and (much less written about, though fascinating) EPL. And much later, the place where the paramilitaries will exert seemingly unparalleled control over economic and political life. <br/><br/>Ballve is interested in the role of the state in Colombia’s wars and especially Uraba. It is a common refrain that in places like Uraba, the state is weak or absent, and so Hobbesian violence emerges. Ballve argues that, instead, in these places other kinds of order emerge: imposed first by the guerrillas (who bring significant political infrastructure in the region) and later the paramilitaries. <br/><br/>Ballve’s narrative of the paramilitaries is where the book really shines. In many readings of the conflict, the paramilitaries are shadowy figures with little/no ideological worldview, notoriously violent and predatory. Ballve’s depiction is, frankly, surprisingly \"sympathetic\" (or at least more nuanced). He establishes quickly and convincingly that the paramilitaries, like the guerrillas, relied on social bases of support. And like the guerrillas, they had a vision for the region, a vision that is confused, unclear, and incoherent in parts, not so dissimilarly to the guerrillas. <br/><br/>The level of institution building the paras took on surprised me. The extent to which they resettled these lands with new peasants, who expressed some degree of loyalty, also surprised me. There’s also a ton of eye-popping anecdotes on here I hadn’t heard about; the paras foray into ecotourism, their development of JACs in the region, the fact that when land restitution ultimately comes to Uraba it is with tacit para approval. <br/><br/>Before reading this book, I thought the absence of the (effective, legitimate) state in large swaths of Colombia’s territory was a major factor in the war. After reading this, I still (mostly) feel the same way. I’m not sure I buy the move Ballve makes here – that state absence can’t explain violence, because other orders emerge. The orders he describes don’t seem to last all that long, and they seem normatively worse than an (effective, legitimate) state. <br/><br/>All said, impressive book!</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>La dimensión desconocida</strong> by Nona Fernández<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> January 21, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>In *La Dimension Desconocida*, a blend of fiction and memoir, we follow the author as *she* follows a variety of real people who lived through Chile’s dirty war. At the center is “the man who tortures”, a man – and a real person, Andres Antonio Valenzuela Morales – who participated in torture and forced disappearances during the dictatorship, later defected, revealed all to the press, and fled to France from where he would continue to provide testimony, validate faces in photographs, etc. <br/><br/>This book was headed for a 3/5 star rating but it won me over. So much has been written about Chile and Argentina’s “dirty wars”, it would seem the well has run dry. What the author of this book does best is vividly capture how the dirty war stained everything about ordinary life with horror. Part of what was unique about the dirty war was how centrally located it was; these are not “human rights abuses” happening overseas, or in Abu Ghraib, or in Guantanamo Bay. It is as if, in Times Square or Central Park, in some nondescript building, agents of the state were brutally torturing their captives. The torture centers are not special institutions, they are not the concentration camp, they are (now) regular homes, or offices. <br/><br/>What’s more: the torture was happening, and everyone knew. Nona notes this again and again: people are snatched up in broad daylight, out of a bus, and everyone can see but pretends not to. She could be sanctimonious about this but she is not; it is just a fact of life, she is not telling us she would have done differently. She is also surprisingly empathetic towards “the man who tortured”, whom we learn was basically a boy when he was compelled to torture (by whom?). It’s an interesting balance: it is a book that on the one hand is deeply critical and on the other primarily conveys the feeling of empathy. <br/><br/>The weight of the disappeared is also captured movingly: the sheer terror of someone vanishing without a trace. There’s a devastating moment early on, when some of the first bodies are found, and the families who are searching first realize that what they are likely searching for at this point is bodies. <br/><br/>There’s also an incredible amount of history here that I simply did not know. I had no idea how deep into the end of the Pinochet regime disappearances and violent reprisals kept taking place. <br/><br/>The author is and was deeply involved in activism around historical memory in Chile. I think that’s perhaps the reason why the book doesn’t grapple with the fact that, for many in Chile, the dirty war was something more distant, either because of when they were born or because those in their social network were left relatively untouched. She makes small allusions to this – her son being too bored to join her at the marches – but to me, this is part of what’s interesting about debates over historical memory. Someone more removed could look at that time period and think “well, if the government was known to be in the business of hunting and killing communists and socialists, why would anyone be one during this time? Unless…”. I think this kind of thinking permeates \"casually conservative\" opposition to historical memory, and it’s not an unreasonable first glance at these situations. <br/><br/>That said, I think (Marco Rubio voice) this book totally dispels with the notion that the dirty war was primarily or mostly targeting subversive elements. The book makes the powerful, simple, hopefully obvious point that being a communist does mean the government gets to torture and kill you. The book does this by showing us again and again how cruel and especially cowardly the dirty war was.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument With Historical Illustrations</strong> by Michael Walzer<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> January 09, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>I took a moral philosophy class in college that has stuck with me for a variety of reasons, one being that the professor told us all that semester that he had been denied tenure and would be dismissed from the university. At the time, i thought, “wow, that sucks” but as I’ve gotten older the pure horror of it has set in: to have one of the few tenure-track professorships in *philosophy* and to lose it, is brutal. And to relay this to a bunch of dead-eyed college students is also tough. <br/><br/>I loved that class and bring this up because the best parts of this book remind me of that class. Part of what’s great about philosophy is to encounter some (moral) question, have a strong intuition about its answer, and then have the philosopher throw examples at you that break your intuition. Just one example from the book: the violation of Belgian neutrality by Germany is clearly bad, but what about British violation of Norwegian neutrality in WW2? Books like this are a great reminder of how often we reason from outcomes rather than from first principles. <br/><br/>Walzer is fairly “moderate” when it comes to what makes war just or unjust. He gives states and soldiers a fair amount of leeway in waging war – although it’s not always so clear to what extent Walzer is making the case for a moral stance versus simply describing the existing conventions around war. He’s good at “steelmanning” what might at first seem like morally noxious stances, for instance, that retaliatory violence could be permissible in war. I was pleasantly surprised by this; he thinks through the issues deeply and with some degree of compassion for the people who fight. There are places where I think he is more convincing (the use of the nuclear bomb was immoral), and places where he is less convincing (his arguments around the Vietnam War), but he’s clear and effective. <br/><br/>My favorite chapters: on the use of indiscriminate violence against civilians (e.g., fire bombing of Germany/Japan); on the use of nuclear bomb; on how technology changes the war convention (e.g., the introduction of submarines to naval warfare); the chapter on guerrilla war. <br/><br/>PS: picked this up because it is apparently frequently assigned at West Point.</p></details>\n</li> \n</ul>\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n### Summary statistics\n\n\nHere are some \"big picture\" summary statistics about my reading:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n<caption>Summary statistics</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> First logged book </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Total pages read </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Average rating (out of 5) </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Median publication year </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Male authors (%) </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Feb 2022 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 21,403 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3.41 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2008 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 72 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHere's the distribution of book ratings:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbooks |> \n  count(my_rating) |> \n  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(my_rating), y = percentage)) + \n  geom_col(color = \"white\", fill = pal[7], alpha = .9) + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1), labels = scales::percent) +\n  labs(x = \"My rating (1-5)\", y = \"Percent of books\") + \n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Other descriptives\n\n\nHere's the correlation between my rating, the average rating on Goodreads, how long it took me to read the book, and when the book was originally published:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nbooks |> \n  select(duration, my_rating, average_rating, original_publication_year) |> \n  cor() |> \n  round(2) |> \n  as_tibble(rownames = \"variable\") |> \n  kable(format = \"html\", digits = 2) %>%\n  kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"width: auto !important;
