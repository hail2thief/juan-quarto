There is something satisfying about keeping a record. I track what I'm reading on Goodreads (awful app), and what I'm watching on Letterboxd (very good app). I rate everything using each app's rating system: Goodreads is 1-5 stars, whole stars only; Letterboxd is 0-5 stars, half-stars are possible. \n\n\nThe ratings data could be an interesting exercise on selection effects in data collection. Reading a book takes so long that I am not picking books at random and reading and rating them. I instead do a fair amount of research beforehand and pick things I imagine I will like. This has two consequences: \n\n1)  my ratings are pretty clumpy, made worse by the fact that Goodreads only allows whole-star ratings. I'm giving many different kinds of books similar ratings. \n\n2) my ratings are anchored by the minimum level of quality that I am willing to read. A book that I rate a 1 or 2 out of 5 is still way better (or at least in my opinion) than many books that I would not even consider reading. \n\n\nMovies, on the other hand, are much easier to get through, even bad ones. So we should probably see more variation in my ratings; helped too by the fact that Letterboxd allows for half-star ratings. \n\n\n\n\n### Cleaning the data\n\n\nNeither service has an easy API at this point, so I'm manually exporting CSVs every so often to generate this page. \n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nGoodreads does not export the date I started reading a book, so I have to manually add that information.

The lesson was that “extremism in the defense of liberty…” could not work at the ballot box. Of course, it would turn out that the shift toward conservatism would happen anyway, and that it would pay dividends with Reagan. <br/><br/>This book was written long before Trump became president, which makes the parallels that emerge between the Trump and Goldwater all the more interesting. Both effectively took their party’s nomination by force, against the wishes of the establishment, by tapping into some political vibe that — at least at that point — was unrecognized. For Trump that current was immigration and resentment of identity politics, for Goldwater the free market and the Cold War. <br/><br/>Where the two diverge, of course, is that Goldwater was brutally defeated by LBJ while Trump did what seemed like the impossible, twice. There’s an interesting difference there: the public seemed genuinely put off by Goldwater’s extremism, his desire to dismantle the New Deal welfare state, his international belligerence at a time when people feared nuclear war. Not so for Trump, and perhaps because part of what he does *is* frequently moderate: on abortion, on visas, whatever it is, he is not going to lock himself into an unpopular position. <br/><br/>It’s interesting that a book like this might not be considered as “serious” of history as something written by an academic historian. A great deal of what Perlstein is doing in this book is laying down a record of what happened, with incredible detail, sourcing, quotes: that’s why the book is 900 pages and who knows how many words, it’s so dense. An academic book, on the other hand, would probably be shorter and less about documenting history than laying out some argument. Personally, I am more impressed by this type of writing. <br/><br/>In all, a worthwhile read, although nowhere near as gripping as *Nixonland*. Goldwater is an interesting figure, but not *that* interesting. And definitely not as interesting as Nixon. The long middle part of the book kinda drags on and only comes alive again when we start seeing more of LBJ’s insane-Texan thing. All this makes the length of the book tough to stomach.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Zen at War</strong> by Brian Daizen Victoria<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> November 21, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p><br/>If there’s one religion that, at least the level of stereotype, seems least amenable to violence, it is Buddhism. Yet Buddhists have and continue to commit violence in different parts of the world. How do Buddhists make sense of their actions, in light of their beliefs? Are they hypocrites, “fake” Buddhists, or is there some doctrinal basis for violence in the belief system? *Zen at War* examines this question around the time of Japan’s rising imperial ambitions, from its wars with China and Russia, conquest of Korea, and then through WW2. This book is interesting on two fronts. <br/><br/>First, rather than focus on soldiers / military leaders / etc. who might nominally be Buddhists but are primarily something else, Brian Daizen Victoria focuses on the harder case of clergy, Zen masters, prominent Buddhist leaders, the most serious of practitioners. Here, the result is very depressing: the Buddhist leadership, top to bottom, justified and supported Japan’s war effort and imperial ambitions. One could imagine a religion that supported war via charity, taking care of the sick, supporting the war effort in an indirect way. But Japanese Buddhists aggressively propagandized in favor of the war effort and its inherent justice. In Victoria’s telling, this was ultimately about securing Buddhism’s place within the Japanese state, a status that was shaky especially early on, when periods of nationalist fervor saw the state advocate for indigenous Shinto religions over the foreign-born Buddhist religion. A few Buddhists, especially those closer to laymen than priests, did resist, but paid dearly. Interestingly, many of these were socialist or socialist-adjacent. <br/><br/>Did these leaders do this cynically? And did their actions have some basis in Buddhist teachings? Victoria goes into painstaking detail of how Buddhist leadership justified Japanese imperialism in Buddhist doctrine. Personally, I did not find any of this convincing; it all sounded like the kind of vague, religious mumbo-jumbo logic we’ve heard elsewhere. To me, it seems so nakedly cynical one wonders if these people ever believed the doctrine in the first place. <br/><br/>The second part of what makes this book interesting is that Brian Daizen Victoria is himself a Zen Buddhist priest. His interest in this topic came from his anti-war activism during the Vietnam War, which put him at odds with American Buddhist leadership. The Zen Buddhists do not come across well in this book, which begs the question of how Victoria can sit with his beliefs and doctrinal affiliation while being so aware of the tradition’s history. I personally could not stomach it. <br/><br/>This book is well done but I’m giving it a low rating because of how narrow it is. There’s not a lot here that is generalized, it’s a deep history of a specific set of actors in Japanese Buddhism.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>The Future Is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia</strong> by Masha Gessen<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> November 18, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>> In Soviet Russia, bill kills you!<br/><br/>There’s a spectrum of writing about Putin’s Russia and, indeed, all major non-democratic countries aligned against the US (Iran, Venezuela, etc.). At one extreme are the “anti-imperialists”, people like Mark Ames, who see virtually no discernible difference between the quality of democracy in the US and that of Putin’s Russia. If CNN will not call the war in Gaza a genocide, then there is no difference between that and Russia’s state-run TV station. These same people will describe everything Russia does abroad as “strategic”, a necessary reaction against the aggression of the West, adjectives that never seem to apply when Western countries do these exact same things. At the other extreme are painfully earnest liberals like Masha Gessen, author of this book, who will not concede even an air of similarity between the US and Russia, the latter literally “totalitarian” and pathological. As one can guess, I find both of these extremes bizarre. <br/><br/>I really did not like the tone of this book, which insists on not just describing events on the ground but telling the reader how they should feel about them. This gets tedious, fast: when the police beat up peaceful protestors, I don’t need to be told this is a “brutal violation of human rights”, I get it. I agree! By the same token, we are given precious little in the way of description of Alexander Dugin’s worldview, which Gessen clearly sees as post-hoc bullshit (Gessen even tells us Dugin was a layabout who refused to work and had life handed to him). Again, I don’t need convincing that Dugin is bad but as a non Russian-speaker I would love to know WTF he’s talking about. It reminded me in this way of Timothy Snyder’s “Bloodlands”, another earnest liberal take on Russian politics. With Gessen’s book, however, it is more justifiable because what she is actually doing here is something more formally interesting, blending parts of their life story into a kind of political memoir.  The memoir portions of the books and the descriptions of life under Putin are where the book shines, even as it primarily relays the lives of relatively well-to-do media types. <br/><br/>Why has Putin ruled Russia for so long? For an earnest liberal like Gessen, the answer is highly pessimistic: the Russian people, essentially, developed a kind of stockholm syndrome during the Soviet Union and they want nothing more than to go back, be enveloped in the authoritarian leader. This is a highly cultural, psychological explanation that is just not convincing. But one gets the sense Gessen is also speaking out of anger here, which is understandable. <br/><br/>Book could have been 70% as long.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Vineland</strong> by Thomas Pynchon<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> November 09, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p><br/>> Brock Vond's genius was to have seen in the activities of the sixties left not threats to order but unacknowledged desires for it. While the Tube was proclaiming youth revolution against parents of all kinds and most viewers were accepting this story, Brock saw the deep — if he'd allowed himself to feel it, the sometimes touching — need only to stay children forever, safe inside some extended national Family.<br/><br/><br/>Pynchon’s books feel like they are either about the plot or about the writing: at one extreme he is doing insane free-jazz shit with language and at the other its paint-by-numbers storytelling. If [[Mason & Dixon]] is closer to the free jazz extreme, Vineland is closer to a plain vanilla story, at least by Pynchonian standards. Unsurprisingly, I liked it much better than M&D. It has a lot of similarities to Inherent Vice but is nowhere near as funny or engaging (I liked IV better). <br/><br/>What makes Vineland stand out in its own right is Frenesi, a (former?) radical and mother who shocks everyone by falling for the fed (Brock Vond) who is on her tail and, in the process, abandons her daughter and partner. Vineland is a world of radicals whose time has passed, who have compromised, where movements are disintegrating, and it is not clear what, at the time the book is set, comes next. We see this through the eyes of Prairie, Frenesi’s daughter, for whom this world of radical / hippie / counterculture is already largely the prior generation’s thing, something in the past but also marked by betrayal. <br/><br/>What’s interesting about the world Pynchon sets up is that it is not so clear *why* this has happened, just as it is never clear why Frenesi falls for Vond. It is (in my view) *not* the case that the feds simply dismantled all these movements, that this is a story about successful, violent, counter-revolution. Something more subtle happened, more organic, a kind of drift. The Tube certainly has something to do with it, the commodification of the counter-culture through (among other things) rock-and-roll and consumerism. But again, I don’t think it’s the simple, 60s burnout theory of “they brainwashed us”. It is more as though the Tube picked up on something that was already there, a sorta tendency towards conformism. Besides all that, I found Prairie and Zoyd’s relationship very sweet. <br/><br/>Look forward to seeing what PTA did with this.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>The Jakarta Method: Washington's Anticommunist Crusade and the Mass Murder Program that Shaped Our World</strong> by Vincent Bevins<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> October 30, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>It takes a long time for this book to get off the ground, probably 50%-60% of the way in before I started hitting content that felt new. This is a shame because the book is pretty short. Bevins is looking at anticommunist campaigns globally, which means he moves very quickly over (at this point) well-known cases. In the introduction, he foreshadows an incredible “coincidence” in the anticommunist campaigns he covered in his reporting. As he moved across instances of US covert action in the Third World, I wondered, is the “coincidence” that the US was doing this in all these places at once? Or that what they did in one place, they tried / did in another? That seems pretty obvious!<br/><br/>The coincidence turns out to be something narrower, less obvious: that the anticommunist campaign in Indonesia was “ground zero” for the tactics that would be deployed in other contexts. Brazilian leftists in the 1960s might find “Jakarta is coming” spray-painted in their neighborhoods, and some of the cast of spooks in Indonesia also show up in Guatemala, Brazil. The details and scale of the extermination of the Indonesian left was entirely new to me. I’m on the market now for a history of this period. <br/><br/>Ft. Leavenworth also stood out as an understudied site of anticommunist training. The School of the Americas is infamous, but I’d honestly never heard of Leavenworth outside of my family. And here, an interesting / disturbing personal connection: my grandfather (whom I didn’t know), was in the Colombian military, and spent some years in Leavenworth in some kind of program. This is *why* my father was randomly born in the US (in those years they were living in Kansas), which in turn is *why* we were able to fairly easily acquire US citizenship after migrating in the 1990s. I always joked my grandfather came to the US to learn how to torture communists, but maybe he actually did. <br/><br/>Another thing I found interesting was anticommunism as an ideology, especially in South America. Most people have some vague sense that many LA militaries had a strong anticommunist culture, and there are a few non-military groups that are well-known (Mano Blanca in Guatemala), but otherwise it’s perceived as this external, Cold-War contingent thing. What one sees in the book, however, is that even as the Cold War is winding down and the US doesn’t care as much, there are still some who are obsessed with the idea of purging the society of communists. Bolsonaro is the most famous example, but there are others. <br/><br/>At the same time, Bevins does have some “tics” of left-wing analysis of IR/foreign policy that I find annoying. First, the insistence that anticommunists were primarily driven by paranoia, that the true communist “threat” was extremely exaggerated or wouldn’t have materialized in the absence of repression. Second, the insistence that, yes there were openly communist / socialist movements / parties / candidates, but actually these were socially democratic and not revolutionary, or rather that they were interested only in national liberation. And third, that revolutionary communism / socialism was an obvious and/or naturally-appealing ideology to people in the Third World. <br/><br/>To me, these set of facts are in tension (if communism was a naturally appealing ideology then it stands to reason it would be threatening to the US during this time) and also fundamentally don’t deal with the fact that knowledge at the time was only partial. As Bevins notes, Indonesia at its peak had the largest communist party in the world outside of the communist regimes, with a staggering two million members. Bevins might claim that a correct reading of their programme would tell you that the US should not have been concerned about a revolutionary Indonesia, but one can also understand why that wouldn’t be convincing to natsec people in Washington. <br/><br/>What leftists like Bevins want to do here, understandably, is appeal to liberals who are critical of these anticommunist campaigns but are also squeamish about communism. This leads them to either want to “disarm” the Cold War, by treating it as either all a big misunderstanding — the anticommunist crusade either targeted “innocents” exclusively or leftists who were not revolutionary but incrementalists — or a ruse to advance the economic interests of elites (i.e., United Fruit Company). <br/><br/>But the Cold War is more complicated than that. As Bevins acknowledges, the US carried out shockingly radical levels of land reform via expropriation in some countries (shout out to [[How Asia Works]]). And they tolerated (had to) open left-wing movements in Europe to a greater degree than in the Third World. I also think that it seems hard to believe there would not have been more Soviet or communist-aligned regimes in the world had these brutal anticommunist campaigns not happened. I’m (hopefully obviously) not saying the anticommunist campaigns were good, right, worth doing, etc. More that, the History 101 view of the Cold War as a battle between communist and capitalist ideologies is not entirely wrong and something you have to grapple with in reading about this period. <br/><br/>Overall, a worthwhile read with lots of little insights that can spin off into further reading or research ideas.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>A History of Modern Uganda</strong> by Richard J. Reid<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> October 15, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>With a title like this, you imagine an introductory, chronological history of Uganda, one that is maybe focused on the 20th century. This is instead a series of essays on the history of Uganda (in strange order), and not introductory; the level of detail is truly bizarre at times. If you read this without some basic Ugandan history in your pocket you will get lost. Even then, you will probably skim large portions of the mega-paragraphs in this book. As always, however, there are interesting things here. <br/><br/>First are the parallels between Obote, Idi Amin, and Museveni, each of whom take office (by force!) on a mission of unifying the country, rejecting “sectarianism”, and whatever was in vogue at the time with respect to economic policy (with Amin it was state-led development, with Museveni, structural adjustment). These good feelings don’t last, at least in part because, in taking power by force, the country is left full of real and potential enemies that need to be contained or repressed. I ended up drawing on this a lot for my paper on Abiy Ahmed in Ethiopia. <br/><br/>Second is the deeper history you get here of precolonial Uganda, a period I only had read passing reference to. The little I knew, echoed here, is that prior to the British Ugandan Protectorate there were a series of kingdoms that were fairly autonomous. The British team up with seemingly the most powerful of these, Buganda, to conquer and incorporate the others, although only partially; in the end, the North of Uganda is left famously underdeveloped and there are other kingdoms that retain more autonomy. These kingdoms persist politically until Obote famously breaks their back, brought back later by Museveni (?) but only as cultural institutions. An interesting accident of history here is that the North, by virtue of being rebellious and “needing” to be forcefully conquered through military rule, comes to both develop a kind of militaristic culture and becomes associated with militarism in the eyes of the British. The British then heavily recruit from the north to staff the Ugandan military, which ultimately lays the foundation for the conflicts and coups post-independence. <br/><br/>This precolonial history gets at the question of what role colonialism had in Uganda’s trajectory (and the development or underdevelopment of Africa more broadly). It seems to me both progressives and conservatives largely assume that, pre-Europe, there was “not much there” politically speaking; it’s the Europeans who either ruined (progressive) or improved (conservatives) the continent. At least in Uganda, however, there are clearly large political units in existence, engaging in conflict and conquest with one another, etc. Reid, in fact, describes the British as effectively being coopted by Buganda against its rival kingdoms. The puzzle then is: on the one hand, it seems clear that the British lumping all of these kingdoms together and putting them under the thumb of one group would lead to bad outcomes. On the other, it is not clear that these kingdoms absent intervention were on the road to prosperity (none of them, for instance, were strong enough to rebuff the British), or that they would have avoided conflict with one another (they were fighting long before the British arrive). <br/></p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>The Fort Bragg Cartel: Drug Trafficking and Murder in the Special Forces</strong> by Seth Harp<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> October 07, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>This book, about a series of drug-related murders in Fort Bragg (Fayetteville, NC),  can be read at a couple of different levels. The lowest level is “true crime”, where the book is simply reporting on these strange, scandalous murders in what seems, from a distance, like an elite, prestigious subset of the military. At this level, you wonder why not watch the netflix/hbo docuseries that I’m sure is already in the works. <br/><br/>One level up is a story about two more \"universal\" dynamics in how countries prosecute wars. The first is about covert action, which the average person imagines is an important yet relatively small proportion of how wars are fought. Harp argues that covert actions are in fact a large proportion of fighting abroad, and that they look much closer to “domestic”, mafia-like forms of violence – assassinations, poisonings, blown up cars, etc. – than the image the public has of uniformed army personnel carrying out discrete missions abroad. An interesting claim in this book, which I had not considered before, is that the growth of special operations units like Delta Force takes off post-Vietnam and post-US public reckoning with the CIA’s actions abroad, which resulted in house/senate intelligence committees to whom the CIA and FBI are supposedly meant to report their behavior. Delta Force like units get to do the kind of stuff the CIA was doing during the Cold War without that oversight. <br/><br/>The second dynamic is about recruitment, that who armed organizations (armies and rebel groups alike) recruit matters for how civilians are treated in war. Abduct your soldiers, rely on conscription, or provide “moral waivers” (as the US during the surge) and you get lower quality recruits who are in turn more likely to do very bad things and contribute to a culture where evil is met with impunity. At an interpersonal level, there is something almost tragic for the operator themselves whom, in receiving constant slap on the wrists for egregious behavior, never receives consequences or other “checks” on their behavior that might help them correct course. <br/><br/>In the special forces case, Harp is emphatic that the US is effectively selecting for near-criminal types, who not only seek out and commit gruesome acts of violence but also blatantly engage in drug trafficking. The drug trafficking part of the book is easily the most shocking: that special forces troops, spending years in places like Afghanistan where there is both a lively drug trade in opium *and* a total corruption of the political system by the drug trade creates opportunities for these operators to become involved in drug trafficking. This is also a story as old as time: that states make allies in foreign wars with groups who are often “unseemly”. This is a feature and not a bug, since the groups most likely to ally with the US (or whatever foreign power) in domestic conflict are those who are most rapacious to begin with. <br/><br/>One more level up is the level of “parapolitics”, a genre of writing about politics that leans on the conspiratorial, arguing that what we see on the surface is a reality that has been massaged by shadowy forces who are directing everything behind the scenes. Harp is clearly inspired by works in this genre and aims for some of his claims to land at this level. This kind of work, of course, makes me nervous because the scale of the claims being made are enormous; it is difficult to see how strong of evidence we would require to accept them. Harp here, for instance, casually says that the war in Afghanistan was a kind of elaborate ruse to funnel taxpayer money to defense contractors who in turn kicked shares back to politicians in DC to “keep the war going”. This feels too looney tunes for me to take seriously without a lot more work on Harp’s part, and it’s not there. <br/><br/>One reaction to Harp’s claims here is to ask how new this is in world history. My guess is not: neither in the west nor anywhere else, especially in the past. States carry out nasty, covert operations in their enemies’ territory; they hire brutal people who do brutal things; the gush of money used to fund this stuff is subject to substantial corruption. Why then is this so shocking to hear? This is especially “funny” when you consider Harp’s politics, clearly in the “anti-imperial” / the intercept / radio war nerd / etc. camp of (putting it uncharitably) seeing everything through the lens of “anything the US does is motivated by imperial ambitions / internal corruption and everything its enemies do is a form of maybe noble / at minimum understandable resistance”. These people will be the first to tell you that international norms are a lie, international law is a smokescreen, etc., but then point, exasperatedly, at violations of these norms/laws.<br/><br/>My guess is that what Harp is rubbing against is this sense that we live in a fundamentally new era, where militaries are perfectly under civilian control, and where the penalties for human rights violations are so severe that even if soldiers want to commit war crimes they rarely do so because they fear the repercussions. What this book shows is that this is closer to fantasy than reality.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine: A History of Settler-Colonial Conquest and Resistance, 1917–2017</strong> by Rashid Khalidi<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> September 30, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>The title made me think this would be a doorstopper history of the hundred years of conflict in Palestine. But the book is actually pretty short (~250 pages) and less of a history than an argument. Khalidi,  who was involved in much of the politics of the time via Lebanon, takes the reader through the conflict in chronological order but focuses on the critical points of debate, e.g., was there really a pre-1948 Palestinian “people”, did Zionists intend to expel the Arab population or was it a “natural” by-product of war, how sincere were efforts at Oslo, etc. You can guess the direction of these arguments, which is not to say that they are not well-made or unconvincing. But I was hoping for a bit more; especially disappointing (no fault of the authors’) is not having Khalidi’s views on October7th. That said, he is a passionate advocate of his people and someone with credible experience and analysis.  <br/><br/>Khalidi’s main thesis is to argue that Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians is a form of colonialism, down to the very first Zionist movements which, Khalidi argues, imagined their project as a colonialist one, that they only move away from once colonialism takes on a bad taste post-WW2. That said, even if we accept this premise, there are some unusual features here, the most obvious one being that unlike other settler colonial states, Israelis a kind of cultural/normative claim on the land that enjoys a decent level of global acceptance, given the fact that Jewish people have lived in the area (as minorities) for thousands of years, their historical persecution in other countries and, of course, the experience of the holocaust. As Khalidi notes, this bit of “bad luck” for the Palestinians amounts to it seeming implausible to say that Jewish people were “colonizing” the land where their religion began. <br/><br/>Khalidi is also much more temperate in his claims and his apportioning of blame than many others writing on this topic. I read Max Blumenthal’s *Goliath* book while I was traveling through Israel in the 2010s, the tone of which is so hysterical it is nearly unreadable. He is plain in seeing the early objectives of the Palestinian movement – a full return to the pre-1948 status quo, the rejection of Israel as a state – as ultimately foolish. It would be interesting to hear his thoughts on “river to sea” discourse post-2023. Khalidi also seems to have especially little good to say about the PLO and Arafat, who he sees as ineffective and out of touch, the latter a function of the org’s exile to Tunis. <br/><br/>This was an interesting dimension I had never properly appreciated. The PLO became *the* actor representing the Palestinian people during much of this time and yet its leaders were not even living in the territories (obviously, because they could not). Khalidi seems to think they absolutely fucked up Oslo I and II and agreed to things they should have not agreed to out of a position of weakness. Another interesting fuck up is Arafat’s decision to waffle / endorse Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait, an invasion that literally every other Arab state had denounced or explicitly resisted via arms because of its obvious violation of state sovereignty. This led the PLO to lose Gulf funding and experience other setbacks that hurt during the Oslo accords. Khalidi also has only criticisms for Hamas and Islamic Jihad, whom he sees as setting the Palestinian cause back during the second Intifada, especially through their use of suicide bombings. <br/><br/>Who is right and who is wrong in the debates Khalidi is speaking to is is obviously important. But right or wrong on these questions does not imply answers as to what should be done now that we are 100 years, as Khalidi says, into the conflict. Even if one perfectly argued from first principles that the Sioux should not have been expelled from the Dakotas, it does not follow that we should displace some white family of five in Bismarck. I think Khalidi would agree. He is unambiguous about this: there is no solution to this conflict in which Israel does not continue to be a state. Towards the end of the book, Khalidi sets up three endpoints for colonial projects: full defeat/extermination of the indigenous population (i.e., North America); a reversion to indigenous rule via revolution (i.e., Algeria); a reconciliation of the dominant and subjected populations (i.e., South Africa). You can tell his hopes are in the last outcome. <br/><br/>Again, would love to know his thoughts on the situation post-October 7th.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>War in the Age of Trump</strong> by Patrick Cockburn<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> September 28, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>I listened to this on audiobook and learned that, mercifully, the “ck” in the author’s last name is silent(?). This will definitely make it easier to discuss his books in my classes. <br/><br/>I loved his last book, *Age of jihad* and have used it in my classes. I was also more familiar with The time period that that book covers — starting with the us invasion and onto the emergence of Isis — than the period covered here. That might be one reason why I didn’t enjoy it as much. <br/><br/>The other reason is that Cockburn’s ideological viewpoint — anti-imperial, reminiscent of the views you get from the intercept, radio war nerd, that crowd — was less heavy in the first than in this one. That’s probably because the anti-imperial take on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are pretty vanilla, closer to the norm. But with the war in Syria, the anti-imperial crowd went off in weird directions, taking the “if a country / group confronts the USA / west then that’s anti-imperial and therefore good” to incredible conclusions. <br/><br/>Chapter 3 was probably my favorite. It covers Al Baghdadi’s disastrous rule over ISIS from 2014 onwards. It’s an interesting case study of ideology → suboptimal behavior: at first, the Kurds stay neutral on ISIS, using the jihadis conflict with central gov’t as opportunity to grow Kurdish holdings. But ISIS attacks Kurds in Syria, turning them against ISIS and ultimately linking them to the US. This was seemingly done because al-Bhagdadi viewed everyone as an enemy, at least partially on religious / sectarian grounds. <br/><br/>Other notes: the format of his books is interesting. There’s parts that are pure war diary / war correspondent (and these are a treasure) and usually the leading chunk of each section is cockburns post-hoc analysis. A funny thing about reading this book now is that cockburns intense conviction that the us and their allies are on a fools errand, that Assad would not fall to some ragtag jihadis, looks silly now that we know he does in fact fall to such a group. The future is hard to predict</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Museveni's Uganda: Paradoxes of Power in a Hybrid Regime (Challange and Change in African Politics)</strong> by Aili Tripp<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> September 24, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>The best part of my job is that I get paid to learn about the world. Two months ago, the most I could have told you about Uganda was how it was spelled. But I was pulled onto a project, mostly as a methodologist, located in the north of Uganda, and so now I need to know more than I did before. This book has been part of the effort to correct my ignorance. <br/><br/>Tripp more or less sees the hybrid nature (semi-democratic, electoral autocracy, all synonyms as far as I can tell) of the Ugandan regime as the core of the country’s politics. In her view, hybrid regimes suffer from contradictions not present (to the same extent) in full democracies or autocracies. Leaders of hybrid regimes must allow some basic level of civil rights and political competition while at the same time containing them so that they do not meaningfully alter their hold on power. A core problem is that there is no neat and easy way for leaders to cycle out of office in these systems. Leaders must (?) use patronage and violence to remain in power, which: a) makes many enemies in the process, and b) means exiting power is a dangerous proposition. Tripp illustrates these ideas by focusing on Museveni, who has ruled Uganda since the 1980s, when his rebel movement took power by force. <br/><br/>There are many interesting insights in this book about Ugandan politics and leadership in hybrid regimes more generally. For one, Tripp identifies a common pattern in these regimes, in which leaders come into office promising reform but quickly fall back on the old forms of rule. This was true of Uganda’s last three major rulers (Museveni, Amin, Obote) who came to power explicitly identifying sectarianism as Uganda’s central ill, of which Uganda has several: a north-south divide, a protestant-catholic divide, the pre-Ugandan kingdoms, as well as ethnic categories. Yet once in power they end up organizing systems of ethnic patronage that favor their “home” communities. Tripp would argue this tendency is structural: without institutions to exit power peacefully, leaders must anxiously surround themselves with those who seem likely to be loyal. <br/><br/>Another is Uganda’s switch from a “no-party” system, in which Museveni’s NRM movement (also called “the movement”) was seen as indistinguishable from the state, to a multi-party system in the early 2000s. This reform seems at least partially instigated by international donor pressure, who seem to play a “questionable” role in Ugandan national politics. <br/><br/>A final one is Uganda’s remarkable number of active conflicts and an enormous IDP and refugee population in the north. Tripp enumerates 12 distinct episodes since 1986 (note: her book was published in 2010). There are aggrieved ethnic groups in many parts of the country, but the north is especially plagued by instability, where the infamous Joseph Kony-led Lord’s Resistance Army operated. As is always the case, reading about the LRA in this book made me realize they were much more “political” than typically depicted in media. Their organizing mission appears to be the representation of the Acholi ethnic group in the north, even if they behave in ways that seem contradictory to those political beliefs (e.g., by targeting members of this group). The cross-border stuff is also fascinating, both Ugandan incursions into the DRC for what seems like unabashed pillaging of natural resources, as well as the proxy war with Sudan to their north. <br/><br/>This is an academic text, for sure, but comes out ahead of its competitors by leaning on theory and story-telling relative to hammering at simple causal claims with an abundance of data (something I enjoy, but in article format).</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>The Golden Road: How Ancient India Transformed the World</strong> by William Dalrymple<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> September 12, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>Ancient history is a tough read for me. To go from a modern world with roughly 200 state units, all organized in relatively recognizable ways, to the ancient world where the relevant state actors might be proper noun kings, emperors, etc. I can’t find my bearing and my eyes begin to glaze over. <br/><br/>I was hoping Dalrymple would break open the ancient world for me. I’m a huge fan of his work. *Return of a King* was excellent, and his *Empire* podcast is great. Sadly, it didn’t take. I read the first few chapters carefully, the one on the early history of Buddhism was interesting. We associate Buddhism so much with the far east, and Hinduism with India, that we forget Buddhism was originally Indian. I was also reminded of *The last temptation of saint anthony* in the way that at the time when Buddhism is beginning to form as a spiritual practice there are dozens and dozens of other existing religious belief systems in India. It would take state power in the form of Emperor Ashoka to spread Buddhism throughout the subcontinent, and for similar moves to take place in China, powered by traders and travelers. <br/><br/>But the rest of the book was a slog and I largely skimmed it.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>I Am Dynamite! A Life of Nietzsche</strong> by Sue Prideaux<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> September 09, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>_“One repays a teacher badly if one always remains nothing but a pupil_.”<br/><br/>Biographies have a bad habit of lionizing their subject. There’s even a word for this, “hagiography”, and it’s lame because you feel like you’re being spoon-fed something instead of coming to your own conclusion. To my surprise, *I am dynamite!* does the exact opposite of this, although it’s not clear to me how intentional. This is, on the whole, a pretty unflattering portrait of Nietzsche, and not because of his supposed association with Nazism, which the author is adamant about rejecting. <br/><br/>The book is unflattering on a personal level: Nietzsche seems like a small man, neurotic, delusional, totally flaccid. There is at least one woman in the book who, in first meeting him, is shocked by the discrepancy between Nietzsche the writer (passionate, viril, confident) and Nietzsche the person, who seems to melt into the background. I felt the same sense of surprise whenever the author quotes directly from Nietzsche. Anyone who’s read him would probably agree he does not lack passion, whatever you think of his ideas. <br/><br/>Three things stick with me by the end of the biography. First, the unusual, libertine culture among cultural figures during this time in Germany. At the center is Richard Wagner, whom Nietzsche is obsessed with, almost to the point of an erotic relationship. There are many love triangles, and at one point Nietzsche even enters a sort of polycule with a woman and a man, the latter two having paired up first on the mutual agreement of no sex, since they both found it disgusting. It is incredible how much of Nietzsche’s short life is spent on these relationships. <br/><br/>Second, the degree to which Nietzsche’s illnesses shaped his life. I knew Nietzsche had been ill and that he had died in a state of steep mental decline, but I had imagined it was more self-contained. In fact, it was the bulk of his life. He would be ill for long spells, sometimes half the year or more, and his vision rapidly deteriorates in adulthood. This radically shrank his ability to work, and is one reason for his interest in aphorisms; he did not have enough time in good health for longer form writing. <br/><br/>To be sick during this time seems especially gruesome, given the low quality of medicine. He spends years receiving painful treatments (enemas, bleeding) that (we now know) have no bearing on what ails him. There are also some darkly funny moments here: at the time, problems with eyesight were thought to be caused by excessive masturbation. Since Nietzsche was single late into adulthood and either seemingly averse (or just very private) about sex, people speculated that he was a masturbator. Incredibly, Richard Wagner writes letters to Nietzsche’s doctor expressing his belief that Nietzsche’s ailments are the result of him being an excessive masturbator and (IIRC) the doctor even recommends Nietzsche visit brothels. <br/><br/>Third, the incredible story of Nietzsche’s sister, who seems like a real piece of work. I vaguely knew, before reading this book, that Nietzsche’s association with Nazism was somehow her fault. It turns out his sister was a rabid antisemite, something that, interestingly, neither Nietzsche nor their mother shared despite all being very close. They seem almost bewildered by her obsession with the Jews. In one incredible moment, the sister marries an even bigger antisemite than her and they move to Paraguay to start a colony, “Nueva Germania”, that would exist on antisemitic ideals. Moving to Paraguay, just years after the war of the Triple Alliance (in which Paraguay is almost exterminated), all to get away from the Jews seems like peak “cut off your nose to spite your face”. <br/><br/>The colony fails and she fails, in almost every regard, except that she is the one left holding all the cards when Nietzsche’s mother dies, leaving her unopposed to manage his archive and to live with him while he is in this horrible catatonic state. Truly creepy, I would read a book just about her. <br/><br/>I loved Nietzsche as a teenager. I wonder if he holds up. <br/></p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>A Popular History of Idi Amin's Uganda</strong> by Derek R. Peterson<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> September 08, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>I remember watching *The Last King of Scotland* in high school and thinking it was great, even rewatching it a few times. It probably says something that, despite watching the movie so many times, I  had no idea what country Idi Amin was in charge of, or where Uganda was on the map. I picked up this book to correct my ignorance as I start working on a research project with some relevance to Uganda. <br/><br/>This is a straightforward academic text. Every chapter could be a standalone article; each starts with an overview of the big picture takeaway; then a page break, the empirical content to support the takeaway; and then a page-break to conclusion. I will never understand why academic writing, supposedly aimed at an audience more attuned to difficult reading, traditionally spoon feeds the reader like this. That said, an interesting and worthwhile book about Uganda’s most famous leader. Less a comprehensive overview and more a series of chapters that each touch on a theme of his rule. <br/><br/>Here are some things that stood out. First, the fact that Uganda is composed of kingdoms, which persisted through British colonialism and into independence. Each kingdom was pretty close to autonomous, with its own laws, parliament, and even police force. For Idi Amin’s story, the most important kingdom is Buganda, encompassing the modern day capital of Kempala. During independence, each kingdom seems to want to go its own way, especially Buganda. There are also strong inter-ethnic tensions among the country’s many communities. <br/><br/>A weak electoral process brings Obote to power whom, because of the pre-existing kingdoms, has little in the way of actual power. His first move is to thus crush the ancient Kingdoms, famously so the kingdom of Buganda. Given these pre-existing forms of political organization and hostile neighbors, Obote’s government is a “nervous state”, paranoid of overthrow. With good reason, it turns out: he is ultimately overthrown by one of his generals, Idi Amin, while Obote is out of the country in 1971. <br/><br/>Second, that at the time of independence there are a number of South Asian people living in Uganda (analogous to other British colonies, such as Trinidad and Tobago). These communities skew better off, tending to own significant amounts of small capital, businesses, etc. There is deep resentment of this population: one of the earliest forms of popular mobilization around independence is a boycott of South Asian businesses. Idi Amin’s early rule will focus on expelling this community from Uganda as part of his so-called “Economic War”. This is, by the way, how we get Zohran Mandami as the likely mayor in NYC; his father is a famous Ugandan academic who was expelled during this time. <br/><br/>Third, while Idi Amin’s brutality is well known (the “Hitler of Africa”), I had less exposure to his efforts to make Uganda the frontline of anti-colonial struggle in Africa. A very interesting moment is that early on (even pre-coup, it seems) he is in close contact with Israel, who offer him training and support. But after a trip to Mecca in the 1970s he breaks off all contact with Israel and pivots to a Gaddafi-inflected pan-Africanism. He seems to wage very little actual war on this front, mostly a matter of presentation: author tells a story of Idi Amin training and arming fighters to go to South Africa / Rhodesia, but this is all for show: they are made to return weapons and even uniforms after the photo op. Culturally, Idi Amin’s regime will do a lot more: banning mini skirts, wigs, Evangelical Christianity, change the names of streets, etc. <br/><br/>In the end, Idi Amin’s regime ends when he invades neighboring Tanzania and the latter counter-mobilizes, invades Uganda, and unseats him, shocking everyone given Idi Amin’s grip on the country. <br/><br/>As with reading about any leader who use repression to close off imagined coups, one wonders to what extent the leader’s level of paranoia is warranted. Liberal-democratic re-tellings of these periods (thinking here of the Southern Cone countries, or the Soviet Union) tend to emphasize the “imagined” part: that the paranoia, fear of an internal threat, of wreckers, etc., is objectively overblown. But if you personally coup’d your predecessor, what else are you supposed to think?</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Quantum Criminals: Ramblers, Wild Gamblers, and Other Sole Survivors from the Songs of Steely Dan (American Music Series)</strong> by Alex Pappademas<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> September 07, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>This book feels like it was written with me in mind. *Quantum Criminals* is not a biography, it’s a series of essays on Steely Dan, each using a specific song (chronological order) in their catalog as a jumping off point to talk about their influences, approach, the lyrics, and Donald and Walter. I *loved* this format: read a chapter, catch what song they are discussing, pop that on, back to the book. I would happily read more books like this, especially about bands that I’ve struggled to “get”. <br/><br/>More than the format though, the way the authors frame Steely Dan’s status in the culture  captures how I have felt about the band. For people my age, growing up on indie rock bands that emphasized a sincere, low-fi / low-effort authenticity, the glossy sound of Steely Dan and other 70s soft rock bands reads as fake, overly produced, everything anathema to “real music”. Of course, as you get older, you realize that making sure everyone’s wearing flannel or having songs that start with someone plugging a guitar into a hot amp, studio chatter, or the drummer counting them in, are no less “fake”: these are all choices being made to deliberately convey some kind vibe. <br/><br/>With the Dan / yacht rock renaissance I’ve come to appreciate their music more, although I still wonder to what extent my enjoyment is sincere. That said, they have undeniable bangers. “Peg” does something weird to my brain, it feels impossibly groovy; reminds me of Mario kart music. And lyrically what they are doing is much more complex than I realized, more in the Dylan vein of songwriting. <br/><br/>Would recommend the behind the album documentary on YouTube about Aja to pair with this book.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Mason & Dixon</strong> by Thomas Pynchon<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> September 07, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>In college (or was it grad school?) my now wife and I went to India with another couple. We took trains all the way from Mumbai to Dharamshala, and part of the way back. On those long train ride (20+ hours) with nothing else to do, no phones, etc., I read *Gravity’s Rainbow* and was blown away. <br/><br/>Not only had I never read anything like it before, I also feel it broadened my ability to read and my appetite for difficult books. One: to focus less on the internal logic of the story and more on the meaning of the writing; in all his books, Pynchon is riffing and improvising and just doing crazy jazz shit with language. Two: to be OK with losing the thread of the story, getting lost, or turning to secondary sources to figure out what the hell is going on. I think for most people, that experience of getting lost triggers a defensive reaction: if there is no grand plan for the plot or the prose, then this is pointless, like hearing someone press random keys on a piano. But just as with improvisational music, the whole point is the musician/author’s ability to dance on that line between unintelligible noise and something sublime. <br/><br/>Since then, I've read *Inherent Vice* (IMO: the PTA movie the best book adaptation of all time) and *Lot 49*, both of which I loved. That said, *Mason & Dixon* beat me. An absolute slog to get through. The plot itself is barely there, the prose so obtuse, and the time period not one I am familiar enough with to really feel like I had my bearings. Maybe it’s unfortunate timing – I started reading this a few weeks prior to my daughter’s birth, and then finished in the following months, sleep deprived, starving for entertainment. Maybe not a great time for difficult books. <br/><br/>There are a few standout moments. Surprisingly enough, as much as I wanted them to get to America already my favorite parts of the book are in the earlier sections, when they’re in South Africa and sailing. And then towards the end, the Hollow Earth stuff was interesting. But the story within the story felt tedious and too little “happens” while they’re in America to make the juice worth the squeeze.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>When the Clock Broke: Con Men, Conspiracists, and How America Cracked Up in the Early 1990s</strong> by John Ganz<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> September 01, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>> With the inspiration of the death of the Soviet Union before us, we now know that it can be done. With Pat Buchanan as our leader, we shall break the clock of social democracy. We shall break the clock of the Great Society. We shall break the clock of the welfare state. We shall break the clock of the New Deal.. We shall repeal the twentieth century.<br/><br/>I’m still not sure how we went from: a world where newspapers with large teams, high-quality editing, expensive reporting, and numerous “big deal” op-ed writers would struggle to get people to sign up for $20 a month, to now: where an individual writer, singularly producing blog posts with often no editing, at unspecified intervals, can get many, many people to fork over $5 a month. I’ve tried subscribing to a few but I don’t even like the rambling, long-form blog format for free, let alone paying for it. <br/><br/>Anyway, this is part of John Ganz’s fame (though apparently he now also writes for The Nation). I have never read John Ganz before this book, but I am impressed. This could easily be my favorite book of the year. The writing is superb, and the level of detail he wrings out of the cast of characters in the book — people you you think you “know”, like David Duke — reminds me of Rick Perlstein’s work. But while Perlstein’s books are way too long, Ganz cuts through the fat. <br/><br/>The book’s thesis — never fully elaborated, even in the introduction, just left to the reader to connect the dots (very cool; the antithesis of academic writing which needs to spell everything out, down to an enumerated list of what each chapter is about; even though ironically academic writing is supposedly aimed at a more “specialized” audience) — is that the early 1990s is *the* period to look at to understand the current MAGA-right’s roots. I left the book feeling like I understood something new about Trump, MAGA, and whatever is going on with the people in the Thiel-verse. <br/><br/>There are many parallels between the 90s and today. The chapter on David Duke alone is worth the price of admission. His racism is obviously well-known, but the fact that he was a major grifter (constantly trying to raise a buck off his supporters), vain (he got a ton of plastic surgery), and good at TV makes an uncanny resemblance to Trump at times. <br/><br/>The paleoconservatives, also discussed here, are a clear intellectual influence on MAGA. The idea that America is in decline, that there’s a new world order, that Americans are being taken advantage of by foreigners (at that time, it was Japan that drew ire), etc., that’s all in MAGA but especially the hatred of the more neo-con wing of the Republican party. All of this is captured perfectly in Rothbard’s essay advocating for a radical, populist conservatism. <br/><br/>Even culturally, you have the rise of a loneliness epidemic in the discourse, especially among young men; concern about the rise of talk radio and parasocial relationships (clear analog to today’s podcasts); a moral panic about crime in urban areas, and of course, the Rodney King trial giving way to riots, aclear analog to summer of Floyd (one of many interesting details being that the beating was caught on camcorder by a neighbor, the footage effectively going viral before virality was a thing); and a Democratic Party that feels it has lost too many recent elections, with an ascendant moderate wing blaming losses to Reagan on the party’s progressive faction. <br/><br/>Many similarities, what is different? The big difference to me seems to be Bill Clinton. In response to a cultural turn to the right, Democrats put up a candidate who was willing to embody very conservatively coded policy positions *and* persona. For example, Clinton famously flew back to Arkansas to oversee the execution of a man on death row with significant mental deficiencies. He didn’t just do this, he *campaigned* on it, which is wild to think about a Democrat doing today. As far as I can see, there is nothing like this emerging within the Democratic Party. But who knows; maybe this is the year.  <br/><br/><br/>PS: the chapter on Ruby Ridge and the White Nationalist movement was also fascinating, would read a book just on that.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Lou Reed: The King of New York</strong> by Will Hermes<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> August 25, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>*Lou Reed: The King of New York* seems like the most complete biography of Lou Reed out there, covering his childhood, time with the Velvets, solo career, and his death in 2013. <br/><br/>A personal anecdote about Lou Reed: I went to graduate school imagining that I would do qualitative, deep history research on Colombia’s armed conflict. Then I got there and all anyone wanted to talk about were coefficient estimates, standard errors, and natural experiments. I went through a crisis: is this really what I want to do? If I do it “their” way, am I selling out? If I do it “my way”, will I not be able to write for a living at all? What do I even want to do, really?<br/><br/>I was in therapy at the time, both for grad school woes and for some difficult family dynamics. My therapist then laid out the story I would come to re-learn in this book: that Lou Reed starts out his music career writing songs for this strange record label, *Pickwick Records*. The company, interestingly, was proto AI slop: they would hire musicians to quickly and cheaply write a ton of songs about specific themes (e.g., songs about going to the beach; Reed famously wrote a “do the dance” song called “Ostrich”). So the story goes, the payments from writing this garbage is what allowed Reed live as a musician and eventually write some of the influential rock music of all time. So the lesson is something like: you can be practical and still true to yourself, whatever that is. <br/><br/>It is interesting in the book that Lou does not sweat this at all; there is no crisis of legitimacy, “am I a sell out”, etc. It is clear he sees working for Pickwick as practical and not a reflection of him as a person. This ethos continued throughout his life as he licensed his music / persona for commercials (clearly influenced by Warhol in this regard as well): having his songs appear in a Ford commercial or whatever is fine if it lets him finance his weird, commercially unviable rock albums. The experience also turned out to be useful to Reed: the Pickwick workflow of putting music out at inhuman speeds came in handy for the Velvets, who were operating on shoe-string budgets. Note: they actually recently released his Pickwick record music as a standalone album. <br/><br/>Anecdote aside, my exposure to Reed was through the Velvets, a band that made a huge impression on me as a teenager, drawn to the band’s experimental sound and “edgy” lyrics. I still remember hearing the song “Heroin” for the first time and being blown away by the droning viola, the drumming, Lou’s delivery, and of course, the vivid lyrics about shooting up. I would eventually make my way through the band’s other albums and fell in love with the music. Even today, it is still in heavy rotation at the house. <br/><br/>Given this exposure, one of the more surprising things about the book is how short-lived and unsuccessful the Velvet Underground’s tenure was. Shorter still once you realize that Lou kicks John Cale out of the band after *White Light/White Heat*, meaning that what for a long time had been my favorite album (the self-titled LP) was not, really, a fully VU record. <br/><br/>One of the things you want out of a biography is a sense of the historical figure as a person. The view that emerges of Lou is a pretty unflattering one. He is controlling and nasty to people around him, both near and distant; you have the fallout with Andy Warhol which, from Warhol’s diaries, we can tell was extremely painful (and needlessly so). There is also berating of service staff of all kind, both during his chaotic years of addiction *and* his post-sobriety-ish, Tai Chi master, later period. He is painfully thin-skinned, calculating, someone who frets about how much others are getting (relative to him), where he is in the pecking order, how others perceive him, etc. <br/><br/>These latter qualities might produce someone who is always trying to do whatever is “in” at the moment, without much vision or sense of organic direction. But this is not true of Lou, which in the end is one of the most touching elements of the biography. There are all these tensions in Lou, maybe between his person and the character he plays on the records. Lou was insanely prolific, even publishing a photography book late in life, a quality that runs counter to the desire to protect one’s image. His solo music, perhaps the only exception being the excellent *Transformer*, is also almost invariably out of step with the times, deeply uncool. Too many examples to point out: the Edgar Allan Poe album, the over-the-top edgelord lyrics (“Harry’s circumcision”), and of course the infamous last album with the deeply uncool Metallica. Whatever you say about him, he clearly had vision and passion, which I found inspiring. <br/><br/>The last chapter, detailing his relationship with Laurie Anderson and death, was unexpectedly touching. Here is a man who has “done everything” and, in the twilight of his life, throws himself into a new relationship, martial arts and Tai Chi (shout out to the song “Lou Reed”, by Cory Hanson). Basically: there is always more life to live. Whatever corner you painted yourself into, whatever constraints you imagine on yourself, you can always do something new.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>How to Talk So Little Kids Will Listen: A Survival Guide to Life with Children Ages 2-7</strong> by Joanna Faber<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> August 24, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>*How to talk so little kids will listen* is a sequel (?) to the classic 1970s parenting advice book. From what I can tell, the core ideas are much the same. <br/><br/>An interesting thing about the book is that it doesn’t foreground a particular philosophy about child-rearing. There is definitely one there, but it is more subtext than text. The authors are not telling you “this is the way the child works”, they are more presenting approaches to problem-solving common challenges with children. <br/><br/>The philosophy that the book does espouse about child-rearing is that one should take kids, and especially their emotions, seriously. This might sound obvious, but as a parent, it is often not. Imagine a toddler asks you to cut a strawberry in half, regrets it and asks you to reverse that process, then tantrums when you cannot. In these moments, it is hard to see past the insanity of what they are crying about. In other words, it is easy to see little kids as irrational, or at least the stuff that upsets them. <br/><br/>And maybe it is irrational. Maybe they get upset about a wider, less compelling set of things than adult do (though if we are honest, we let ourselves get upset about plenty). But they are upset nonetheless, and you cannot tell someone who is upset not to be upset. It doesn’t matter if the reason they are upset is that they were brutally fired from work, or if they ate their M&Ms in the wrong order. <br/><br/>This was a really effective component of the book: drawing analogies between what children are feeling in these moments and what we feel as adults. These analogies make very clear why acknowledging emotions is important. You can't tell an adult who's mother died that they should stop crying, their mother was old and sick anyway. <br/><br/>In practice, this means talking to you child with empathy about what they are upset about. It also means modeling how to deal with these emotions and problem-solve, which is not easy. But it rings true to me. There's a ton of ideas here, and the \"workshop\" narration (parents in a room talking to one another about issues, approaches, etc.) works great. <br/><br/>I also appreciated how much the book highlights the parents’ experience; it’s not just about the kid. There’s a short chapter in particular on when parents feel overwhelmed by anger at something their child is doing, which I found refreshingly candid. That anger is not ideal, but it is also part of life: children will run into people who they will make angry or who will become angry at them for a variety of reasons, people close to them or strangers. They need to learn how to deal with these moments, and it is also instructive post-rage to come back together and “make up”: that this is a healthy part of human life. <br/><br/>Like with all things, not everything works like you imagine. I was struck by a passage where the author, whose kid is struggling with starting/stopping tasks (e.g., playing), gets a timer with a shade that shrinks as the timer counts down, so the passage of time is visible and thus intelligible to a little kid. I immediately ordered that clock, showed my two year old, set a time to play until we had to leave for school. He picked up the clock, and simply added more time. :)<br/><br/>I’ve been going through some parenting struggles and this book really did it for me, I’m all in with this shit. <br/></p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Your Two-Year-Old: Terrible or Tender</strong> by Louise Bates Ames<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> August 14, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p><br/>This book is part of a series by the child developmental psychologist Louise Bates Ames. Each short book covers a year in the life of the child. The books cover, in broad strokes, how the child is changing psychologically, socially, emotionally, physically, etc. <br/><br/>I was motivated to read this because my two year old was driving me insane, nearly to the point of tears. I truly wanted to know: what the fuck is going on in there? Why is he doing all this? <br/><br/>I have to say: I got a lot out of reading this. Short, to the point, and the right tone for me as a parent: fairly relaxed, low stakes, more about adjusting your expectations to your child than what more contemporary child-rearing books tend to emphasize, which is *improving* or *maximizing* your child in some respect. I feel that I understand my two year old better after reading. <br/><br/>If I had to characterize Ames’ approach for a child this age it is to avoid confrontation, which does not mean caving to the child’s demands, more of the way that in judo you use your opponent’s momentum against them. Basically, where you can avoid confrontation, avoid it: don’t ask questions where the answer can be “no” or where they can refuse without consequence, because they will. At two, the child is testing the boundaries around what is possible, discovering to some degree their autonomy. They will refuse, reject, want to do the opposite of what you request almost by nature. <br/><br/>One parental instinct here is to say “that is unacceptable”, the world does not revolve around them, I will hold my ground. Ames would say this is basically fruitless because the refusal is literally part of the developmental stage that they are in. And it is a stage, they will not stay there. It is therefore OK / advisable to instead leverage the fact that you are much smarter than them to divert their attention, change the subject, etc. At least this week, I feel like this works; who knows about the next. <br/><br/>The book has a fair number of bad reviews, due I think to its age (written in the 1970s), which shows in many parts. Things like the book warning you not to let your kid touch the dash when they’re riding in the front seat with you is funny now. There’s also a ton of gendered assumptions in here with respect to mothers and fathers. Doesn’t bother me; seems easy enough to mentally replace: “a stern warning from Dad” with a “stern warning from [the more strict parent of the two / the most intimidating member of the polycule]” . I actually found it touching how much of the book felt timeless. <br/><br/>One last reaction is that as someone in the social sciences, I can’t help but be skeptical about the harder claims in the book. How, exactly, could Ames “knows” what is going on in the child’s mind? She also breaks stages down to 6 month intervals, which seems impossibly precise. I personally do not remember what my son was like at 2 years versus 2 and a half, versus now. Of course, Ames is careful to note that all children are different, and so basically all of what she says could not apply in your particular instance. So… what are we doing here? I guess you just have to believe. <br/><br/>Worth the read. I bought year 3 too. Do I peak ahead to see what this monster has in store for me or leave it as a surprise?</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>My Name Is Red</strong> by Orhan Pamuk<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> July 30, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>*My name is red* is Orhan Pamuk’s  best-known book, at least in the West. Pamuk is also Turkey’s best-known fiction writer, at least in the West. So this is Turkish fiction 101; something like picking up Marquez as a first stab at Colombian (or even Latin American) fiction. I wanted to read this after listening to the excellent Empire podcast on the Ottoman Empire ([[Fall of Ottoman Empire, empire pod]]). I also picked up *The Ottomans*, which is still sitting on my bookshelf. <br/><br/>The story follows a group of miniaturists – an art form based on embroidering texts with depictions of historical events, battles, etc. – in the late 1500s Ottoman Empire as they grapple with their changing art form and the mysterious murder of two of their members. The story is told in a relational style: each chapter is a character relating events to the reader who is at the same time placed in the position of some unidentified third party that exists in the story. <br/><br/>The most straightforward read of the book is as an allegory for Turkey’s unique place in the world, a country that straddles “east” and “west”. Pamuk’s miniaturists are consumed with anxieties about the seeping of “Frankish” style (i.e., Western Renaissance art) into their art form. The discussion of the differences in style are some of the most interesting parts of the novel. The miniaturists, for instance, are especially troubled by the use of perspective in Frankish art, which they perceive as a kind of idolatry. Their traditional art form instead “lacks” perspective, imagining itself as presenting the world as Allah sees it: trees, dogs, buildings, people, all the same size, flattened in some sense. <br/><br/>Part of the reason they are anxious about these new forms they are coming into contact with is that there is something alluring about them. This is key to the allegory, IMO: it is not the case that the western forms are being exogenously imposed on Ottoman artists. At this point, in fact, the Ottoman Empire is arguably at the peak of its power. Rather, there is something innately alluring about Western art, especially portraiture, which Ottoman leaders (the Sultan) instinctively finds appealing because of its grandiosity and projection of power. <br/><br/>This ambiguity is where I think Pamuk keeps the reader in most of the novel. We should find something distressing about the encroachment of Western art, the loss of these indigenous art forms. But we should also probably be disturbed by the orthodox, puritanical rejection of those who burn down the storyteller’s tavern at the end of the book. <br/><br/>Parallel to all this is interesting fodder is an epic love triangle romance with great characters, world-building, dialogue, etc. This is peak historical fiction.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Right-Wing Women</strong> by Andrea Dworkin<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> May 05, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>*Right-wing women* got billed as an analysis of women on the right by the firebrand feminist Andrea Dworkin. But the book is much broader than that, also delving into Dworkin’s broader feminist framework, social value in a gendered society, abortion, reproductive technologies, and so on. There's actually not a ton here on \"right wing women\" as such. <br/><br/>I’d heard of Dworkin before, mostly through her role in the \"pornography wars\" discussed in [[The right to sex]]. This was my first time reading her work directly. <br/><br/>Dworkin's style is to make big, sharp claims (a big change from [[The right to sex]], which felt like all elaboration and no hard claims); she is machine-gunning ideas; she is sarcastic, angry, funny; when she’s really going, it's great. <br/><br/>The standouts are the first, standout chapter, “The promise of the ultra-right” and the chapter on abortion. Her take on right-wing women is that they, like left-wing feminists, are acutely aware of the violence and domination that is inherent (Dworkin is a bit unclear on this) to relationships with men, and so seek a compromised (false) safety in marriage and control over reproduction via opposition to abortion. As Dworkin writes, “the Right promises to put enforceable constraints on male aggression, thus simplifying survival for women”. She looks at specific anti-feminist women of the era, whom I had known little about and found fascinating. Phyllis Schaffley being a war hawk in her origins but pivoting to women’s social issues because the Reagan administration would not give her a formal role was an interesting bit of history. <br/><br/>Dworkin’s takedown of the hippie movement and the counterculture in the abortion chapter is particularly brutal and effective, maybe the best part of the book: “[sexual liberation] did not free women. Its purpose – it turned out – was to free men to use women without bourgeois constraints”. Here she is writing directly from experience about the abuse and dismissive treatment of women in the radical organizations of this period.<br/><br/>Aside from these chapters, however, the writing is rough. The rest of the book is truly a slog. The writing is just *so* repetitive; she repeats sentences, for rhetorical effect no doubt, and I could imagine a speech where the repetition works. But not as a book. The content is also less interesting later on, amorphous. The most precise claims in the latter half of the book is chapter on Christianity, where she makes the (very odd) claim that homophobia is unique to the New Testament and that in the Old Testament, whatever prohibitions were in place, were in some broad sense perhaps more tolerant (?). It’s an odd piece. <br/><br/>It would be interesting to know what Dworkin would say about the world today.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>La guerra del fin del mundo</strong> by Mario Vargas Llosa<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> April 17, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>The “end of the world” in the title refers to a remote town in the state of Bahia, Brazil, where a staggering 25,000 people, led by a messianic figure / cult leader known as  Antônio Conselheiro (“Anthony the Counselor”), lived in open defiance of the Brazilian state in the late 1800s. The town,  Canudos — apparently now gone, flooded by a damn built by the country’s dictatorship in the 1960s – became the site of Brazil’s bloodiest civil war. Federal troops fought bitterly with residents over control of the town, effectively exterminating the town’s inhabitants in the process. The novel is thus about the “War of Canudos”, told from the perspective of various characters on both sides of the conflict. <br/><br/>A messianic figure emerging in Brazil, at this time, when the Brazilian republic is just born and slavery is abolished; the unorthodox nature of the Counselor’s belief system (anti-republican, monarchical, anti-slavery, anti-metric system); the fact that the residents successfully repel multiple waves of federal troops, killing a famous general in the process; this background gave me very high expectations for this novel. This is rich history, in a part of the country that receives little attention. Brazil’s _**sertão**_ is poor, plagued with droughts that produce famines, a kind of desert outback which outsiders rarely associate with Brazil. <br/><br/>I was disappointed with this book. What did I want? The War of Canudos is genuinely bizarre; I wanted someone who could extract meaning, give me a sense for what these people who gathered at Canudos, wanted. This event is important, forgotten to history, but what does it *mean*? I did not come away with a sense that Vargas Llosa (RIP, one of the GOATs) has a clear, convincing view of what the *War of Canudos* means. <br/><br/>The Counselor himself is sparsely detailed in the novel, he doesn’t speak much, there are obvious parallels to the biblical Jesus. The reader’s view of both the Counselor and his followers feels modern, removed: these are people with strange beliefs, cult-like; there is not a ton of room for empathy for these people as *believers* (although certainly as victims, or as oppressed people). I wanted a sense for what it would *feel like* to believe what they believe, but we rarely get much interiority into the characters. Many seem to just become enthralled soon after meeting the Counselor. Now, maybe this is “The Truth” about what happened in Canudos; but it’s not so compelling. <br/><br/>The other side of the narrative is the military and those characters who are foreign to the region. Here, too, I think there is a disappointing lack of engagement with interesting ideas: you have a new republic, but there are debates about what it should look like, and a clear clash between a kind of modernizing liberalism and a reactionary conservatism that is one of the turning points of Latin American politics in the 19th and 20th century. In between, is this town, that doesn’t want to be incorporated. Yet, Vargas Lllosa makes it fairly clear on that on the military side there is not much beyond cynicism, desire for control, etc. Again, maybe the truth, but didn’t grab me. <br/><br/>In the end, the conflict itself feels like more of a backdrop to a story that is primarily a romance, with grand, sweeping emotions and characters who feel-very-strongly. As I read, the movie that I came coming back to was “Gone with the Wind”. That’s fine, but it didn’t grab me. And to top it off: this is a very long book, and dense with characters. Honestly, a slog to get through.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Anti-Semite and Jew: An Exploration of the Etiology of Hate</strong> by Jean-Paul Sartre<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> March 26, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>In *Anti-semite and Jew*, Sartre reflects on the “logic” of anti-semitism in France. It's the end of the second World War, and many French Jews who were deported by the Nazis are beginning to return. In a broad sense, Sartre wants to explore how antisemitism \"works\" at the level of the individual: what does it “do” for the antisemite to be antisemitic? In line with his prior writing, he sees a psychological dialectic at play in the persistence of these beliefs: antisemites and Jewish people locked in a mutually “reinforcing” dance. <br/><br/>It’s an interesting time to read this book. Since Musk took over, my Twitter feed is full of far right accounts, many discretely or openly flirting with antisemitism, Nazi apologism, etc. I’m still in shock about how blatant it is. I can see some of the traits Sartre highlights at play with these Twitter figures. <br/><br/>This book would be hard to write today. As Walzer points out in the preface, Sartre is neither Jewish nor well-versed in Jewish culture. Yet, that does not mean he can’t say something interesting about antisemitism. In fact, he is shockingly candid about how much antisemitism exists in his social circle (unsaid: that he effectively tolerates) and much of his theorizing is specific to his experiences in France. On that front, the etiquette today – that only members of a group should comment on that group – seems bad.<br/><br/>The first chapter on the antisemite is really all that’s worth reading here. And it is a really interesting set of observations, almost aphoristic. He characterizes antisemitism as a *choice* (famously: “if the Jew did not exist, the antisemite would invent him”), that seeks out facts that support the view rather than the other way around, which perhaps distinguishes antisemitism from other forms of “ethnic” hatred. At its core, Sartre diagnoses the antisemite with a desire for impenetrability, a discomfort with the ambiguities of truth. <br/><br/>Especially interesting – thinking back to Twitter, and the right wing accounts who are “haha kidding but not really” playing with antisemitic tropes – is Sartre’s noticing that the antisemite fundamentally “plays”, that there is a layer of amusement (today we would say trolling) to their discourse. “They delight in acting in bad faith”, they do not stand by their arguments because their beliefs are not rooted in reason but a kind of anti-reason. The tension that Sartre notices between the antisemite (and more broadly the fascist’s) love of order, and yet the desire to break that order, is very interesting, the tendency towards hooliganism, pogrom, destruction… I think he also clarifies some things about the concept of the “Deep State” among the modern far right: “Thus for the anti-Semite there is a *real* France with a government but diffused and without special organs, and an abstract France, official, Jew-ridden, against which it is proper to rebel.”<br/><br/>Michael Walzer’s preface is worth reading too, he does not seem like a fan.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Making Empire: Ireland, Imperialism, and the Early Modern World</strong> by Jane Ohlmeyer<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> March 21, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>I was disappointed by this book or, at least, I had the wrong expectations going into it. I picked it up after hearing the author on *Empire Pod*, imagining something more accessible about the history of early English imperialism in Ireland. But the book is very “academic”; the acknowledgments indicate it is based on lectures the author gave in university. Probably as a result, there is a frustrating level of detail throughout, at times giving way too little background on proper noun characters and at others focusing much too narrowly on individual people / towns. All to say, I didn’t get all that much out of reading this. <br/><br/>Here’s what I found interesting: the idea that Ireland is the “first” British colony, the only colonized country in western Europe; the steps the English took to try to “anglicize” Ireland early on; the process of using both settlers (“plantations”) to dispossess the locals *and* (interestingly) the “carrot” of being made nobility to win over the elites; and the way that colonial practices in Ireland would later be reflected in other colonies, down to specific people (one Irish man who worked in colonial policing in Ireland, India, and Palestine). The Irish being sent all over the world was also surprising, but makes sense; that’s how you get the hilariously named Bernardo O’Higgins as a Chilean founding father. <br/><br/>These are interesting ideas but they don’t get a lot of development. There’s also an emphasis on culture and discourse that I know is interesting to some people, but not to me. That colonial administrators in Ireland would conceptualize the island’s “problems” in disease-like language, and that this same language would later show up in India, is not so interesting to me. What I found more interesting was how often the Irish were invoked in North America: “the wild irish and the indian do not much differ”. There’s a dark comedy there where the colonizer recognizes these “similarities” in otherwise very dissimilar peoples but fails to recognize the common denominator (the colonial relationship).</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>How Asia Works: Success and Failure in the World's Most Dynamic Region</strong> by Joe Studwell<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> March 12, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>*How Asia Works* argues that the reason some Asian economies succeeded (the so-called “tiger” economies, e.g., Japan, Taiwan, South Korea) and others failed (e.g., the Philippines, Myanmar) comes down to industrial policy: some states aggressively pointed their economies in the direction of development while others did not. <br/><br/><br/>The book is provocative and interesting to read in light of all that is going on with Trump and his tariffs. Studwell is arguing principally against the neoclassical economic take that state intervention in the economy is bad and that free trade is fundamentally good; in Studwell’s view, free trade is a position that advantages already-rich countries to the detriment of poorer ones, and that if one looks at the history of how rich countries developed, one would see that they did so squarely through heavy state intervention in the economy, via land reform and protectionist policies that sheltered domestic manufacturing, allowing firms to grow and become globally competitive. He uses Asia to test these ideas. <br/><br/>This summary makes Studwell sound like a conventional left-wing economist, but his ideas are actually a lot more heterodox and interesting. Early in a country’s development, he advocates for land reform, and particularly land redistribution – away from feudal estates, and towards smaller landholdings – but on the grounds that these small farms are in fact more competitive, more “capitalist” in some sense, than the big farms where landowners can grow fat off rents. <br/><br/>The history in this chapter is fascinating. I had: a) no idea of the substantial level of land reform and redistribution that some Asian countries took on, but even more surprising: b) the degree to which the US encouraged these reforms both as development measures in their own right (in Japan, Korea, Taiwan) and as counterinsurgency tools to demobilize rural unrest. In Taiwan and Korea in particular it seems the US actively pushed for breaking up big farms, which is shocking. <br/><br/>He is also heterodox with respect to protectionist policies once states are at the development stage where manufacturing is plausible. States need to protect their domestic industries through tariffs and subsidies, but must maintain “export discipline”: that is, the protected industries must be forced to compete in the global marketplace. Absent being forced, domestic industries will happily absorb the subsidies and do little that will generate wider development. So in some sense, a pretty dangerous tool: there needs to be the willpower to push companies to compete globally even when its not in their interest (given protections). The narrative here is also interesting, especially so Korea’s impressive development of car and steel manufacturing so “late” in their history. One feels that if Korea can do it, why not, say, Brazil? <br/><br/>Something striking about the policies that Studwell proposes is that, broadly, they are probably 1) quite painful to implement and 2) unlikely to easily generate a coalition of people who’s interest is in maintaining them. As economists will note, the costs of tariffs and other protections are borne by consumers. We are currently screaming about 6-7% interest rates; Studwell points to something like a decade of 10-15% interest rates in Korea. Could people really tolerate that? In the pursuit of some long term goal? With respect to (2), you can’t help but notice that the people pushing painful development through in South Korea, China and Taiwan are dictators. Can democracies do this? The rich democracies certainly did, so maybe there’s hope. <br/><br/>Overall, the history of state intervention in the economy is interesting in that for most of the time period discussed it actually seems to intersect little with the traditional left-right spectrum or the Cold War. Today these ideas are totally “polarized”: if you’re on the right you oppose intervention, on the left support it, and what’s at stake is some trade-off between efficiency and equity. But for these early leaders, these were simply tools that they could choose to use (or not). Which makes sense: for most of history, the idea that a country’s leaders would “not meddle” in their country’s economic activity was implausible. The question was not if, but how. <br/><br/>I do have to say I found Studwell kind of grating at times. There’s a ton of “telling” in this book but not a lot of showing; huge, vast claims are made about why something happened or what effect X has on Y. Claims about the size of farms, how wealthy or poor people were at some particular time/place, etc., are rattled off, but it’s unclear how Studwell can really “know” any of this. In fact, he reminds me a lot of Noah Smith, who also has an unpleasant tendency to over-claim expertise and to tell these grand narrative type stories that are nice and neat but seem implausibly overconfident. <br/></p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Stories of Your Life and Others</strong> by Ted Chiang<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> February 26, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>Chiang’s move in these short stories is to take what are often obtuse academic concepts and humanize them, give them stakes, and build characters who interact in worlds where these concepts have weight. He draws on hermeneutics in *Tower of Babylon*, linguistics in *Story of your life*, math in *Division by Zero*, etc. <br/><br/>For my money, the standout in the bunch is *Tower of Babylon*. Chiang focuses on the routine, daily mechanics of building the tower; what material to use, how workers make the climb, how people live on the tower. The focus on engineering gives the story a realism that produces a clever dramatic irony where, as you read, you imagine that the builders will discover what you already know: that there is no “vault of heaven”, but rather outer space. This makes the moment when they reach the vault of heaven very effective and opens the narrative up. That the builders never give a positive account of *why* they are building the tower is interesting, especially once the vault is reached and you learn that piercing the vault could trigger world-ending flooding. The question is never “should we do this” but rather the mechanics of minimizing the potential damage. Obvious parallels there to real-world science: the atom bomb, the hadron collider, etc. <br/><br/>The second best story is the one that the book is named after. *Story of your life* is  impressive in sketching out what it would feel like to interact with a non-human language, one that still conformed to some kind of structure. There’s a “pleasure of mastery” as the narrator slowly develops the ability to communicate with the Heptapods. Unfortunately, the story ends up suffering from what I’ll call “Interstellar Syndrome”, referring to the sci-fi movie by Christopher Nolan. Nolan’s movie begins with “hard science” and ends up in the world of “California woo” after the main character falls into a black hole and discovers the universe is powered by Love. This short story similarly made me squirm with the time-traveling bit revealed at the end. <br/><br/>The other stories are not very good.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>The Frontier Effect: State Formation and Violence in Colombia</strong> by Teo Ballve<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> February 06, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>The *Frontier Effect* is a book about Uraba, a region in Colombia near the border with Panama. Uraba is a microcosm of the country’s violent conflicts – you can truly see every element of the conflict at play in Uraba. Early on, an “underdeveloped” backwater that grows quickly due to the booming banana industry and early colonos. Later, a hotspot for guerrilla organizing, especially the FARC and (much less written about, though fascinating) EPL. And much later, the place where the paramilitaries will exert seemingly unparalleled control over economic and political life. <br/><br/>Ballve is interested in the role of the state in Colombia’s wars and especially Uraba. It is a common refrain that in places like Uraba, the state is weak or absent, and so Hobbesian violence emerges. Ballve argues that, instead, in these places other kinds of order emerge: imposed first by the guerrillas (who bring significant political infrastructure in the region) and later the paramilitaries. <br/><br/>Ballve’s narrative of the paramilitaries is where the book really shines. In many readings of the conflict, the paramilitaries are shadowy figures with little/no ideological worldview, notoriously violent and predatory. Ballve’s depiction is, frankly, surprisingly \"sympathetic\" (or at least more nuanced). He establishes quickly and convincingly that the paramilitaries, like the guerrillas, relied on social bases of support. And like the guerrillas, they had a vision for the region, a vision that is confused, unclear, and incoherent in parts, not so dissimilarly to the guerrillas. <br/><br/>The level of institution building the paras took on surprised me. The extent to which they resettled these lands with new peasants, who expressed some degree of loyalty, also surprised me. There’s also a ton of eye-popping anecdotes on here I hadn’t heard about; the paras foray into ecotourism, their development of JACs in the region, the fact that when land restitution ultimately comes to Uraba it is with tacit para approval. <br/><br/>Before reading this book, I thought the absence of the (effective, legitimate) state in large swaths of Colombia’s territory was a major factor in the war. After reading this, I still (mostly) feel the same way. I’m not sure I buy the move Ballve makes here – that state absence can’t explain violence, because other orders emerge. The orders he describes don’t seem to last all that long, and they seem normatively worse than an (effective, legitimate) state. <br/><br/>All said, impressive book!</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>La dimensión desconocida</strong> by Nona Fernández<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> January 21, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>In *La Dimension Desconocida*, a blend of fiction and memoir, we follow the author as *she* follows a variety of real people who lived through Chile’s dirty war. At the center is “the man who tortures”, a man – and a real person, Andres Antonio Valenzuela Morales – who participated in torture and forced disappearances during the dictatorship, later defected, revealed all to the press, and fled to France from where he would continue to provide testimony, validate faces in photographs, etc. <br/><br/>This book was headed for a 3/5 star rating but it won me over. So much has been written about Chile and Argentina’s “dirty wars”, it would seem the well has run dry. What the author of this book does best is vividly capture how the dirty war stained everything about ordinary life with horror. Part of what was unique about the dirty war was how centrally located it was; these are not “human rights abuses” happening overseas, or in Abu Ghraib, or in Guantanamo Bay. It is as if, in Times Square or Central Park, in some nondescript building, agents of the state were brutally torturing their captives. The torture centers are not special institutions, they are not the concentration camp, they are (now) regular homes, or offices. <br/><br/>What’s more: the torture was happening, and everyone knew. Nona notes this again and again: people are snatched up in broad daylight, out of a bus, and everyone can see but pretends not to. She could be sanctimonious about this but she is not; it is just a fact of life, she is not telling us she would have done differently. She is also surprisingly empathetic towards “the man who tortured”, whom we learn was basically a boy when he was compelled to torture (by whom?). It’s an interesting balance: it is a book that on the one hand is deeply critical and on the other primarily conveys the feeling of empathy. <br/><br/>The weight of the disappeared is also captured movingly: the sheer terror of someone vanishing without a trace. There’s a devastating moment early on, when some of the first bodies are found, and the families who are searching first realize that what they are likely searching for at this point is bodies. <br/><br/>There’s also an incredible amount of history here that I simply did not know. I had no idea how deep into the end of the Pinochet regime disappearances and violent reprisals kept taking place. <br/><br/>The author is and was deeply involved in activism around historical memory in Chile. I think that’s perhaps the reason why the book doesn’t grapple with the fact that, for many in Chile, the dirty war was something more distant, either because of when they were born or because those in their social network were left relatively untouched. She makes small allusions to this – her son being too bored to join her at the marches – but to me, this is part of what’s interesting about debates over historical memory. Someone more removed could look at that time period and think “well, if the government was known to be in the business of hunting and killing communists and socialists, why would anyone be one during this time? Unless…”. I think this kind of thinking permeates \"casually conservative\" opposition to historical memory, and it’s not an unreasonable first glance at these situations. <br/><br/>That said, I think (Marco Rubio voice) this book totally dispels with the notion that the dirty war was primarily or mostly targeting subversive elements. The book makes the powerful, simple, hopefully obvious point that being a communist does mean the government gets to torture and kill you. The book does this by showing us again and again how cruel and especially cowardly the dirty war was.</p></details>\n</li>\n<li>\n  <strong>Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument With Historical Illustrations</strong> by Michael Walzer<br>\n  <em>My Rating:</em> ★★★★ <br>\n  <em>Date Read:</em> January 09, 2025<br>\n  <details><summary>My review</summary><p>I took a moral philosophy class in college that has stuck with me for a variety of reasons, one being that the professor told us all that semester that he had been denied tenure and would be dismissed from the university. At the time, i thought, “wow, that sucks” but as I’ve gotten older the pure horror of it has set in: to have one of the few tenure-track professorships in *philosophy* and to lose it, is brutal. And to relay this to a bunch of dead-eyed college students is also tough. <br/><br/>I loved that class and bring this up because the best parts of this book remind me of that class. Part of what’s great about philosophy is to encounter some (moral) question, have a strong intuition about its answer, and then have the philosopher throw examples at you that break your intuition. Just one example from the book: the violation of Belgian neutrality by Germany is clearly bad, but what about British violation of Norwegian neutrality in WW2? Books like this are a great reminder of how often we reason from outcomes rather than from first principles. <br/><br/>Walzer is fairly “moderate” when it comes to what makes war just or unjust. He gives states and soldiers a fair amount of leeway in waging war – although it’s not always so clear to what extent Walzer is making the case for a moral stance versus simply describing the existing conventions around war. He’s good at “steelmanning” what might at first seem like morally noxious stances, for instance, that retaliatory violence could be permissible in war. I was pleasantly surprised by this; he thinks through the issues deeply and with some degree of compassion for the people who fight. There are places where I think he is more convincing (the use of the nuclear bomb was immoral), and places where he is less convincing (his arguments around the Vietnam War), but he’s clear and effective. <br/><br/>My favorite chapters: on the use of indiscriminate violence against civilians (e.g., fire bombing of Germany/Japan); on the use of nuclear bomb; on how technology changes the war convention (e.g., the introduction of submarines to naval warfare); the chapter on guerrilla war. <br/><br/>PS: picked this up because it is apparently frequently assigned at West Point.</p></details>\n</li> \n</ul>\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n### Summary statistics\n\n\nHere are some \"big picture\" summary statistics about my reading:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n<caption>Summary statistics</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> First logged book </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Total pages read </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Average rating (out of 5) </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Median publication year </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Male authors (%) </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Feb 2022 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 25,409 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3.3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2013 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 73.77 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHere's the distribution of book ratings:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbooks |> \n  count(my_rating) |> \n  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(my_rating), y = percentage)) + \n  geom_col(color = \"white\", fill = pal[7], alpha = .9) + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1), labels = scales::percent) +\n  labs(x = \"My rating (1-5)\", y = \"Percent of books\") + \n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](books-movies_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Other descriptives\n\n\nHere's the correlation between my rating, the average rating on Goodreads, how long it took me to read the book, and when the book was originally published:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nbooks |> \n  select(duration, my_rating, average_rating, original_publication_year) |> \n  cor() |> \n  round(2) |> \n  as_tibble(rownames = \"variable\") |> \n  kable(format = \"html\", digits = 2) %>%\n  kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"width: auto !important;
