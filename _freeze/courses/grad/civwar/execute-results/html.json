The course is designed to prepare graduate students to do research on these topics. Each week, we will cover a mix of \"foundational\" and new research in one of the key active research agendas in the study of civil wars. The weekly readings are primarily how students will: a) develop the basics of the literature; b) figure out which topic areas might drive their dissertation work. \n\n\n\n\n\n# Assignments\n\n\n* Participation (10%). I will grade you on the quality of your participation in seminar. Being unprepared, not having done the readings, being absent, etc., will hurt your participation.\n\n\n* Weekly comments (10%). Each week you will post one bullet point comment *per reading*. The goal of your comment is to motivate discussion among your peers. You can raise questions about theory, method, point out conflicts between readings, develop links with previous weeks’ readings, whatever. **Due by 5pm before each class**. \n\n\n* Article review (20%):  You will write one, three-page (or so, double-spaced) article review. Your review should eschew summary in favor of critically evaluating the paper ([a good guide here](https://benjaminnoble.org/blog/reviewing)). The goal is to make a recommendation to an editor (in this case: me) as to whether or not the paper should be published. If your recommendation is to \"revise and resubmit\" assume that implies a high probability of publication. **Due January 22nd, 5PM.**\n\n\n* Guest lecture (20%): You will prepare a lecture on the week's topic and present for 30-40 minutes. The lecture should be aimed at an upper division undergraduate audience. [Guidelines here](#lecture). See the signup sheet for dates. \n\n\n* Replication (20%): You will replicate the primary findings of a paper of your choosing and then extend the paper in some interesting way. [Guidelines here](#replication). **Due Feb 23rd.**\n\n\n* Research design (20%): 8-10 pages. [Guidelines here](#paper). **Due March 20th.**. I encourage you to meet with me about your idea *at least* a few weeks before the deadline. \n\n\n# Course policies\n\n\nLate proposals, papers, etc. will be penalized by a letter grade per day. \n\n\n\n# Schedule\n\n*Note: the schedule is subject to change.*\n\n\n## Week 1 -- Jan 8 : What is civil war? \n\n\n### Required\n\n\n* [@kalyvas:balcells:2010]\n* [@balcells:stanton:2021]\n* [@sambanis:2004]\n* [@fearon:2017]\n\n\n### Recommended\n\n\n* [@ward:etal:2010]\n* [@blattman:miguel:2010]\n* [@kalyvas:2003]\n* [@kalyvas:straus:2020]\n \n\n\n## Week 2 -- Jan 15 : 'Macro' causes of civil war\n\n\n### Required\n\n\n* [@fearon:laitin:2003]\n* [@carter:etal:2019]\n* [@collier:hoeffler:2004]\n* [@hendrix:salehyan:2012]\n\n\n\n### Recommended\n\n* [@buhaug:etal:2014]\n* [@oloughlin:etal:2012]\n* [@horowitz:1985]\n* [@ying:2021]\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nArticle review due: January 22nd, 5PM\n:::\n\n\n\n## Week 3 -- Jan 22 : Ethnicity and conflict\n\n\n\n\n\n### Required\n\n* [@posen:1993]\n* [@sambanis:shayo:2013]\n* [@cederman:etal:2011]\n* Chapter 2 in [@christia:2012]\n\n\n\n### Recommended\n\n\n* [@esteban:ray:2008a]\n* [@esteban:ray:2008]\n* [@denny:walter:2014]\n* [@paine:2019]\n\n\n\n## Week 4 -- Jan 29 : Political economy of conflict\n\n\n### Required\n\n\n* [@paine:2016]\n* [@dube:vargas:2013]\n* [@sanchezdelasierra:2020]\n* [@nunn:qian:2014]\n* [@lichbach:1994]\n\n\n### Recommended\n\n* [Revisiting the Effect of Food Aid on Conflict: A Methodological Caution](http://barrett.dyson.cornell.edu/presentations/Revisiting%20Food%20Aid%20%20Conflict%20Otago%20May%202018.pdf)\n* [@ross:2004]\n* [@azam:hoeffler:2002]\n* [@dalbo:dalbo:2011]\n\n\n\n## Week 5 -- Feb 5 : Rebel groups as organizations\n\n### Required\n\n\n* The introduction in [@weinstein:2007]\n* [@gutierrez-sanin:wood:2014]\n* [@siegel:2011]\n* [@staniland:2012]\n\n\n### Recommended\n\n* [@shapiro:siegel:2012]\n* [@staniland:2012b]\n* [@parkinson:2013]\n* [@tamm:2016]\n* [@balcells:etal:2022]\n* [@shapiro:siegel:2007]\n\n\n## Week 6 -- Feb 12 : Dynamics of violence in civil wars\n\n### Required\n\n\n* Introduction, chapter 6, and chapter 7 in [@kalyvas:2006]\n* [@schubiger:2019]\n* [@carey:mitchell:2017]\n* [@acemoglu:etal:2013a]\n\n\n### Recommended\n\n* [@gutierrez-sanin:vargas:2017]\n* [@albertus:2020]\n* [@cohen:2013]\n* [@condra:etal:2018]\n* [@sawyer:etal:2021]\n* [@sonin:wright:2023]\n* [@valentino:etal:2004]\n\n\n\n\n## Week 7 -- Feb 19 : Civil war duration and termination\n\n\n## Required \n\n* [@cunningham:2006]\n* [@luttwak:1999]\n* [@fortna:2015]\n* Chapter 1 in [@schulhofer-wohl:2020]\n\n\n### Recommended\n\n* [@williams:etal:2021]\n* [@toft:2010a]\n* [@cunningham:2011]\n* [@kaufmann:1996]\n* [@posen:1993]\n* [@lyall:wilson:2009]\n* [@manekin:etal:2017]\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nReplication due: Feb 23rd by end of day\n:::\n\n\n## Week 8 -- Feb 26 : Wartime displacement\n\n\n\n\n### Required\n\n\n* Chapter 1 in [@steele:2017]\n* [@lichtenheld:2020]\n* [@zhou:shaver:2021]\n* [@albarosa:elsner:2023]\n\n### Recommended\n\n\n* [@mcnamee:2018]\n* [@zhukov:2015]\n* [@tellez:2022]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Week 9 -- Mar 4 : Peacekeeping and peacebuilding\n\n\n### Required \n\n* [@walter:etal:2021]\n* [@severine:2019]\n* [@samii:2013]\n* [@sambanis:schulhofer-wohl:2009]\n* [@mattes:savun:2010]\n\n\n### Recommended\n\n* [@russell:sambanis:2022]\n* [@wolford:2017]\n* [@cunningham:2016]\n* [@matanock:2017]\n* [@sambanis:schulhofer-wohl:2009]\n* [@beber:etal:2017]\n\n\n\n## Week 10 -- Mar 11 : Political and social consequences of war\n\n* [@bauer:etal:2016]\n* [@ch:etal:2018]\n* [@tepperman:2002]\n* [@villamil:2021]\n* [@atran:axelrod:2008]\n\n\n### Recommended\n\n* [@grossman:etal:2015]\n* [@jha:shayo:2019]\n* [@sambanis:etal:2015]\n* [@kang:meernik:2005]\n* [@hazlett:2020]\n* [@bara:2018]\n* [@lupu:peisakhin:2017]\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n⭐ *FINAL PAPER DUE MARCH 20th, MIDNIGHT*\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n# Resources\n\n\n\n\n## Guest lecture {#lecture}\n\n\nYou will:\n\n* Present for 30-40 minutes at the start of class on the topic of choice, aimed at an upper level undergraduate who has likely *heard* of the topic (e.g., in the news), but knows little about it\n* Your guiding prompt: \"if you had to give advanced undergraduates a mini lecture on X, what would you say? What is crucial, most interesting, compelling, relevant, etc? What are the big questions, debates?\"\n* Lecture should engage with existing literature, *can* reference some of the week's readings, but cannot be *solely* about the week's readings\n* The group will provide you feedback based on my rubric\n\n\n## Replication {#replication}\n\n\nYou will: \n\n* Find a paper with available replication data\n* Visualize or summarize some interesting element of the data as a figure or table\n* Replicate the paper's main findings + a key figure from the paper\n* Extend the analysis in a theory-driven way, for instance:\n    * Looking at sub-samples where effects *should* be different based on your argument\n    * Looking at interactions such that the effect of X on Y depends on Z (you need a compelling argument as to why Z *should* moderate the effect of X on Y *and* is interesting!)\n\n\nThe final output will be a Quarto document that can compile without error. I will provide a template. \n\n\n\n\n## Final research design rubric {#paper}\n\n\n10 pages MAX, double-spaced.\n\n1. Introduction (2 pages)\n\t1. Motivate why we should care about the question you want to answer (e.g., because of its real-world impact, as a gap in the literature)\n\t2. BRIEFLY preview what the project will do (I will argue that X) and how it will do it (I will collect XYZ data)\n2. Literature review (2 pages)\n\t1. Briefly describe what we already know about your topic\n\t2. Highlight what is unknown or what gap your project will fill\n3. Theory + hypotheses (3-4 pages)\n\t1. Big note: theory != literature review\n\t2. Need an argument about a causal process\n\t3. Think about who the actors are in your story, what they want, and how their interactions produce different outcomes\n4. Research design (2-3 pages)\n\t1. Data\n\t\t1. Where will the data come from? What is the unit of analysis (e.g., country-year)?\n\t\t2. How will you measure the outcome variable(s)? Treatment variable(s)?\n\t\t3. Identification strategy — how will you (try to) identify the effect of X on Y? If prediction, how will you select what variables to include in the model?\n\t\t4. Modeling strategy — how will you model the relationship?\n\n\n\n",
