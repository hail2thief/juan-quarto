This book threw me off my reading streak. For parts it felt like the best science fiction I've read. The focus on the relationships and politics of Mars colonization is interesting, but the book never lets you forget Mars is there and it is not Earth; it has its own challenges. It gives the interpersonal conflicts a sense of weight and realism.

But I fundamentally don't understand why classic, genre sci-fi has to be this long, or why these stories need to stretch across whole series. In my opinion, it hurts the writing, because as the book goes on the seams become more visible, you can see the structure of the book more clearly and the patterns the author is repeating. It feels tedious.
