An unusual book by a historian in that there are no cited sources or really any kind of "show your work" language in the text, which I found frustrating, though there are works referenced in the back.

Hard to find a new angle on the story of the drug trade but the standouts are the early opium trade in Mexico, led by Chinese migrants, the emphasis on the protection racket as the source of violence (and not the drug trade per se), and the argument that the cartels don't really exist in the conventional sense.

Not sure how well the third argument lands. And there is a conspiratorial flavor in some chapters that would benefit from more sourcing given the magnitude of the claims.

But some stuff I might pull here for class.
