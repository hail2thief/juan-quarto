## Overview


The goal of this directed reading is to get better at data visualization. We will: 

- Read books on effective data visualization
- Practice making *good* data visualization in R



## Format

Every week you will:

1. Read about data visualization
2. Meet with me for 60-90 minutes to discuss / present
3. Keep a Quarto notebook of notes and visualizations from each week's content


## What you will need

- The books below
- R and RStudio installed and updated to latest version
- Git installed and a Github account


## Books

- @cairo:2016 (I have a copy)
- @wilke:2019 (free online)
- @healy:2018 (free online)



## Deliverables

- Each week you will turn in a Quarto notebook with your notes / visualizations
- A final code-thru analysis of a dataset from here (or whatever else you want): [Full Archive](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/)
