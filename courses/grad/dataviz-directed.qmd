## Overview


The goal of this directed reading is to get better at data visualization. We will: 

- Read books on effective data visualization
- Practice making *good* data visualization in R
- Meet on Mondays at 9am in my office to discuss



## Format

Every week you will:

1. **Read** about data visualization
2. Complete visualization **tasks** in Quarto notebooks (**ahead of our meeting**)
3. Meet with me for 60ish minutes to discuss / present


## What you will need

- The books below
- R and RStudio installed and updated to latest version
- Git installed and a Github account


## Books

- @cairo:2016 (I have a copy)
- @wilke:2019 (free online)
- @healy:2018 (free online)



## Deliverables

- Each week you will turn in a Quarto notebook with your notes / visualizations
- A final code-thru analysis of a dataset from here (or whatever else you want): [Full Archive](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/)


## Schedule


### `r advdate(mon, 1)` Orientation

Reading: 

- Ch1 in [@healy:2018]


Tasks:

- Make sure everything is installed and you access to all the materials



### `r advdate(mon, 2)` Grammar of graphics


Reading: 

- Ch 2 in [@wilke:2019]
- Ch 5 in [@cairo:2016]    
- Ch 3 in [@healy:2018]


Tasks: 

- make a plot that uses the x-axis, y-axis, and at least two other aesthetics, axis labels, title, and a theme
- make the plot painfully *slowly*, iterating through each addition


### `r advdate(mon, 3)` Amounts and proportions

Reading:

- Ch 6, 10, 11 in [@wilke:2019]


Tasks: 

- make a barplot, stacked barplot, heat map, nested area plot


### `r advdate(mon, 4)` Distributions

 
- Ch 7, 9 in [@wilke:2019]
- [Raincloud plots](https://www.cedricscherer.com/2021/06/06/visualizing-distributions-with-raincloud-plots-and-how-to-create-them-with-ggplot2/)


Tasks: 

- make a histogram, density graph, grouped version of each (e.g, using fill), boxplot, violin plot


### `r advdate(mon, 5)` Relationships

 
- Ch 12, 13 in [@wilke:2019]


Tasks: make scatterplot, correlogram, time series, multiple time series


### `r advdate(mon, 6)` Model output

- Ch 6 in [@healy:2018]

Tasks: make scatterplot with smoothing line, coefficient plot (pointrange), marginal effect plots, regression table with 3 models using `modelsummary` package


### `r advdate(mon, 7)` Annotations

- Ch 17, 18, 22 in [@wilke:2019]
- Ch 5 in [@healy:2018]


Tasks: make a jitter plot, scatterplot with labeled points, barplot with text over the bars, use facet_wrap in a plot, make all plots with title, subtitle, caption, and every aesthetic has a title

### `r advdate(mon, 8)` Maps

   
- Ch 7 in [@healy:2018]
- Ch 15 in [@wilke:2019]
- [Why all the world maps are wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIID5FDi2JQ )


Tasks: make a country level world map or region map where countries filled by some variable using `rnaturalearth`, make a county-level chloropleth map using `county_data` from `socviz`


### `r advdate(mon, 9)` Themes, color


- Ch 4, 19, 22 in [@wilke:2019]
- Ch 8 in [@healy:2018]


Tasks: make a plot using a non-default color or fill scale, make one using a sequential scale, one using a discrete scale, a plot where you use the fact that geometries can have local aesthetics to highlight specific points or bars

  
### `r advdate(mon, 10)` Make own website


- Make sure Quarto is installed on your computer (`quarto --version` in the Terminal should return a version)
- If not, download and install: https://quarto.org/docs/download/
- Create a user account on Netlify
