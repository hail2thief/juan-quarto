## Overview


The goal of this directed reading is to get better at data visualization. We will: 

- Read books on effective data visualization
- Practice making *good* data visualization in R



## Format

Every week you will:

1. Read about data visualization
2. Meet with me for 60-90 minutes to discuss / present
3. Keep a Quarto notebook of notes and visualizations from each week's content


## What you will need

- The books below
- R and RStudio installed and updated to latest version
- Git installed and a Github account


## Books

- @cairo:2016
- @wilke:2019
- @healy:2018



## Deliverables

- Each week you will turn in a Quarto notebook with your notes / visualizations
- A final code-thru analysis of a dataset from here (or whatever else you want): [Full Archive](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/)


## Schedule


### `r advdate(mon, 1)` Orientation

Make sure everything is installed and you have all the materials


### `r advdate(mon, 2)` Grammar of graphics


- "Visualizing data: Mapping data onto aesthetics" in [@wilke:2019]


### `r advdate(mon, 3)` Amounts and proportions
